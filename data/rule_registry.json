According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\nPrevalence: In 2021, 38.4 million Americans, or 11.6% of the population, had diabetes. Approximately 1.9 million American children and adults\nhave type 1 diabetes, including about 244,000 children and adolescents.\nDiagnosed and undiagnosed: Of the 38.4 million, 29.7 million were diagnosed, and 8.7 million were undiagnosed.\nPrevalence in seniors: The percentage of Americans aged 65 and older remains high, at 29.2%, or 15.9 million seniors (diagnosed and\nundiagnosed).\nNew cases: 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year.\nPrediabetes: In 2021, 97.6 million Americans aged eighteen and older had prediabetes.\nDeaths: Diabetes remains the 8th leading cause of death in the United States in 2021, with 103,294 death certificates listing it as the underlying\ncause of death, and a total of 399.401 death certificates listing diabetes as a cause of death.\nTotal economic cost of diabetes care in the United States: $413 billion in 2022.\nDiabetes can be classified into the following categories:\n\u201cType 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune \u03b2-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency)\u201d\n\u201cType 2 diabetes (due to a progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background of insulin resistance)\u201d\n\u201cGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior\nto gestation)\u201d\n\u201cSpecific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young [MODY]), diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as\nwith glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, or after organ transplantation)\u201d  The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is easily established\nwhen a patient presents with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, which include polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, blurred vision, and, infrequently,\nweight loss. The frequency of symptomatic diabetes has been decreasing in parallel with improved efforts to diagnose diabetes earlier through\nscreening. Increasingly, the majority of patients are asymptomatic, and hyperglycemia is noted on routine laboratory evaluation, prompting further\ntesting.\n6,7\n8\n3\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n3/15\nGlycated hemoglobin A1c (also known as HbA1c, A1c, glycohemoglobin, or hemoglobin A1c) testing plays a key role in the management of diabetes.\nNew hemoglobin enters circulation with minimal glucose attached. However, glucose irreversibly binds to hemoglobin based on the surrounding blood\nglucose concentration. Therefore, A1c is considered a measure of blood glucose level, albeit an indirect one. It is best correlated with the mean glucose\nlevel over the last eight to twelve weeks as red blood cells experience significant turnover. Various factors may affect the reliability of A1c (atypical\nhemoglobins or hemoglobinopathies, chronic kidney disease, et al.), but most assays have been standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications\nTrial (DCCT) standard, which \u201cestimated the mean blood glucose concentrations derived from seven measurements a day (before and ninety minutes\nafter each of the three major\u00a0meals, and before bedtime), performed once every three months and compared the average glucose concentration with\nA1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nThe HbA1c assay provides information about the degree of long-term glucose control,  and has been recommended for the diagnosis and monitoring of\ndiabetes.\nVarious methods of HbA1c measurement include chromatography based HPLC assay, boronate affinity, antibody-based immunoassay, and\nenzyme based enzymatic assay.\nLong-term blood sugar control has been associated with decreased risk of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and\ncardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial, cerebrovascular disease,\nand myocardial fibrosis in adults with diabetes.\nHigher HbA1c variability has\nbeen associated with higher all-cause mortality in patients with Type 2 Diabetes.\nFasting plasma glucose is a method of glucose monitoring that measures an individual\u2019s glucose level typically in a period defined with no caloric intake\nfor eight hours or more. Its usage in the diagnosis of diabetes lies primarily in gestational diabetes, along with the OGTT, but HbA1c, FPG, or OGTTs\nwith their respective positive results can be used in diagnosing diabetes mellitus in nonpregnant individuals as well. To diagnose diabetes in\nasymptomatic individuals, a FPG has to be \u2265 126 mg/dL. For diagnosing prediabetes, an individual may have \u201cimpaired fasting glucose,\u201d which would\npresent with a range of 100-125 mg/Dl.\nTraditionally, the diagnosis of diabetes was predicated on plasma glucose levels as well as symptom presentation. In 2010, the ADA endorsed as a\n\u201creliable retrospective marker of blood glucose control over the past 6-8 weeks.\u201d The advantages of HbA1c testing include increased convenience,\nincreased stability and decreased variation in measurement. While the ADA 2023 guidelines gave precedence to FPG, the latest 2024 guideline\naddressed the vital importance of HbA1c for both diagnostic and screening purposes (for both diabetes and prediabetes care).\nThe ADA notes that there are areas where HbA1c is insufficient and plasma glucose levels are the preferred measurement: \u201cIn the presence of\nhemoglobin variants, pregnancy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and other conditions that might potentially interfere with accurate\nHbA1c measurements, plasma glucose levels are preferred. Furthermore, in situations where elevated blood glucose levels might not be consistently\napparent, the diagnosis of diabetes necessitates two abnormal test results (HbA1c and plasma glucose) either simultaneously or at different time points.\nIn such scenarios, alternative biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin emerge as viable options for monitoring glycemic status.\nFructosamine reflects the total pool of glycated serum proteins, mainly albumin, reflecting glycemic trends over a span of two to four weeks\u2014a relatively\nshorter duration compared to A1C. Although these biomarkers show a strong correlation and are associated with long-term complications based on\nepidemiological evidence, the empirical support for their application is not as robust as that for HbA1c.\u201d\nThe OGTT can be more inconvenient and used in the setting to diagnose GDM. Normally, 75g of glucose is ingested by the patient, and if the patient\nhas a two-hour plasma glucose value of \u2265200 mg/dL, a diagnosis of diabetes can be made. The test can also be performed at one-hour with 50g oral\nglucose, with positive GDM diagnostic results between 130-140 mg/dL as part of a two-step approach with the three-hour 100g test, which can be\ndiagnostic of GDM with two elevated values. For prediabetes with an accompanied \u201cimpaired glucose tolerance,\u201d a two-hour plasma glucose value\nbetween 140-199 mg/dL is used. However, the WHO requires an additional FPG <126 in addition to the two-hour plasma glucose value to establish\nimpaired glucose tolerance.\nAnalytical Validity\nThe International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Working Group on HbA1c Standardization has developed a reference\nmeasurement system and the measurement of HbA1c is currently well-standardized,\nand a sound reference system is in place to ensure continuity and\nstability of the analytical validity of HbA1c measurement.\nIn contrast, plasma glucose concentration remains difficult to assay with consistent\naccuracy.\nHbA1c has greater analytical stability (consistency with repetitive sample testing) and less day-to-day variability than either the fasting\nplasma glucose (FPG)or two-hour PG.\nFor any given individual, the HbA1c exhibits little short-term biologic variability; its coefficient of variation\n(CV) is 3.6%, compared to FPG (CV of 5.7%) and 2-h PG (CV of 16.6%).\nA sample proficiency testing survey performed by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and College of American Pathologists\n(CAP) evaluated the accuracy of A1c assays. The survey found that \u201cmethod-specific, between-laboratory CV\u2019s ranged from 0.7% to 4.0%\u201d and\n\u201capproximately 85% of laboratories are using methods with CVs <3% at all five HbA1c levels.\u201d The survey also noted the current pass limit was \u00b16%, but\nusing a pass rate of 97.1% to 98.0% of labs passed.\nClinical Utility and Validity\nTesting A1c, FPG, and 2-h PG measure different aspects of glycemia and are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1c \u22656.5% identifies fewer\nindividuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria; however, a recent study concluded that twelve percent of patients can be misclassified with\nrespect to diabetes diagnosis due to laboratory instrument error in measuring glucose.\nThe New Hoorn Study analyzed the diagnostic properties of the\nA1c, using OGTT as the diagnostic criterion.\nThe analysis suggested that an A1c of 5.8% had a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 91%. This\ncompares with specificity of 24% and sensitivity of 99% for the A1c cut point of 6.5%. On the other hand, the 6.5% cut point had a positive predictive\nvalue of 93%, compared with a positive predictive value of only 24% for a cut point of 5.8%.\nWhen using the reference diagnosis of diabetes being a two-hour blood glucose >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT, the specificity of FPG \u2265126\nmg/dL was >95% and sensitivity about 50%, with possibly lower sensitivities and specificities for individuals over 65 years.27 With the same OGTT\nreference, the specificity and sensitivity of an A1c \u22656.5%, as per diagnosis of diabetes, were reported as 79% and 44%, respectively.\nCowie, et al. (2010) \u201cexamined prevalence\u2019s of previously diagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes and high risk for diabetes using recently\nsuggested A1c criteria in the U.S. during 2003\u20132006. We compared these prevalence\u2019s to those in earlier surveys and those using glucose criteria.\u201d\n14,611 individuals were included (completed a household interview) and classified for diagnosed diabetes and by A1c, fasting, and 2-h glucose\nchallenge values. Diagnostic values for A1c were \u22656.5% for \u201cundiagnosed\u201d diabetes and 6%-6.5% for \u201chigh risk\u201d of diabetes. The authors found that by\nthese A1c diagnostic values, the \u201ccrude prevalence\u201d of diabetes in adults older than twenty years was 20.4 million, of which nineteen percent went\nundiagnosed based on A1c \u2265 6.5%. The authors then stated that the A1c criteria only diagnosed thirty percent of the undiagnosed diabetic group.\n5\n9\n8,10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n3,4\n15\n4,16\n17\n18\n19\n20,21\n22,23\n24\n25\n26\n22\n28\n29\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n4/15\nMamtora, et al. (2021) assessed the clinical utility of point-of-care (POC) HbA1c testing in the ophthalmology outpatient setting. Forty-nine patients with\ndiabetic retinopathy underwent POC HbA1c testing and blood pressure measurement. Of the 49 patients, 81.6% had POC readings above the\nrecommended HbA1c levels and only 16.3% of these patients were aware of their elevated HbA1c levels. Fourteen patients (33.3%) with high HbA1c\nreadings were referred to secondary diabetic services and 88.8% of patients felt like the test was useful. The authors suggest that POC HbA1c testing is\na \"cost-effective, reproducible and clinically significant tool for the management of diabetes in an outpatient ophthalmology setting, allowing the rapid\nrecognition of high-risk patients and appropriate referral to secondary diabetic services.\"\nGoodney, et al. (2016) evaluated the consistency of A1c testing of diabetes patients and its effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The study included\n1574415 Medicare patients with diabetes mellitus, and the consistency of testing was separated into three categories: \u201clow (testing in zero or one of\nthree years), medium (testing in two of three years), and high (testing in all three years).\u201d Approximately 70.2% of patients received high-consistency\ntesting, 17.6% received medium-consistency, and 12.2% received low-consistency. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) included \u201cdeath,\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, amputation, or the need for leg revascularization.\u201d Low-consistency patients was associated with death or other adverse\nevents (hazard ratio: 1.21). The authors concluded that \u201cconsistent annual hemoglobin A1c testing is associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular\noutcomes in this observational cohort of Medicare patients of diabetes mellitus.\u201d\nThe GOAL study used A1c to assess diabetes control in a real-world practice study aimed to assess predictive factors for achieving the glycemic\nhemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at six months as targeted by the treating physician in adults with type 2 diabetes. In this study, 2704 patients with a mean A1c\nof 9.7% were enrolled. After six months, lower baseline A1c (\u2265 8.5% vs <7%) was found to be a predictive factor for achieving glycemic control. The\nauthors also observed \u201cabsolute changes in the mean HbA1c of \u22121.7% and \u22122% were observed from baseline to six and twelve months, respectively.\u201d\nMitsios, et al. (2018) evaluated the association between A1c and stroke risk. Twenty-nine studies (n=532779) were included. The authors compared the\nnon-diabetic A1c range (<5.7%) to the diabetic range (\u22656.5%) and found that the diabetic range was associated with a 2.15-fold increased risk of first-\never stroke. The prediabetes range of 5.7%-6.5% was also not associated with first-ever stroke. The authors also observed that for every one percent\nincrease in A1c, the hazard ratio of first-ever stroke increased (1.12-fold for non-diabetic ranges, 1.17 for diabetic ones). This increased risk was also\nseen for ischemic stroke, with a hazard ratio of 1.49 for non-diabetic ranges and 1.24 for diabetic ranges.\nLudvigsson, et al. (2019) evaluated the association between preterm birth risk and periconceptional HbA1c levels in pregnant individuals with type 1\ndiabetes (T1D). Preterm birth was defined as <37 weeks and several secondary outcomes were also examined, which were \u201cneonatal death, large-for-\ngestational age, macrosomia, infant birth injury, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, five-minute Apgar score less than seven, and stillbirth.\u201d A total of\n2474 singletons born to individuals with T1D and 1165216 reference infants (children born to mothers without T1D) were included. The authors identified\n552 preterm births in the T1D cohort (22.3%) compared to 54287 in the control cohort (4.7%). Incidences of preterm birth were measured at several\nseparate thresholds, including <6.5%, 6.5%-7.8%, 7.8%-9.1%, and >9.1%. The T1D cohort\u2019s adjusted risk ratios (aRR) of preterm birth compared to the\ncontrol cohort were as\u00a0follows: 2.83 for <6.5%, 4.22 for 6.5%-7.8%, 5.56 for 7.8%-9.1%, and 6.91 for >9.1%. The corresponding aRRs for \u201cmedically\nindicated preterm birth\u201d (n=320) were 5.26, 7.42, 11.75 and 17.51, respectively. Increased HbA1c levels were also found to be associated with the\nsecondary clinical outcomes. The authors concluded that \u201cthe risk for preterm birth was strongly linked to periconceptional HbA1c levels.\nSaito, et al. (2019) examined the association of HbA1c variability (defined as visit-to-visit) and later onset of malignancies. The authors included 2640\npatients 50 years or older, with diabetes. A total of 330 patients (12.5%) developed malignancies during follow up. The authors stratified the patients\ninto quartiles of glycemic variability (defined as standard deviation of HbA1c) and found a \u201cdose-dependent association with tumorigenesis\u201d in the three\nhighest quartiles. The odds ratios were as follows: 1.20 for the second quartile, 1.43 for the third, and 2.19 for the highest. The authors concluded that\n\u201cthese results demonstrated that visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is a potential risk factor for later tumorigenesis. The association may be mediated by\noxidative stress or hormone variability.\u201d\nMa\u00f1\u00e9, et al. (2019) evaluated the \u201csuitability of first-trimester fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels in non-diabetic range to identify [individuals]\nwithout diabetes at increased pregnancy risk.\u201d Primary outcomes were defined as \u201cmacrosomia and pre-eclampsia\u201d and secondary outcomes were\ndefined as \u201cpreterm delivery, Caesarean section and large-for-gestational age.\u201d A total of 1228 pregnancies were included. Pregnant individuals with an\nHbA1c of \u22655.8% were found to have an increased risk of marcosomia (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69), an HbA1c of \u22655.9% was found to be associated with a\nthree-fold risk of pre-eclampsia, and an HbA1c of \u22656% was found to be associated with a four-fold risk of \u201clarge-for-gestational age.\u201d FPG levels were\nnot found to be associated with any pregnancy outcome.\nArbiol-Roca, et al. (2021) studied the clinical utility of HbA1c testing as a biomarker for detecting GDM and as a screening test to avoid the use of the\nOGTT. HbA1c levels were measured in 745 pregnant individuals and GDM was diagnosed in 38 patients based on HbA1c, age, and BMI. A cut off HbA1c\nvalue of 4.6% was determined to decide whether OGTT was needed or if it could be avoided. Using 4.6% HbA1c as the cut off value prevented two false\nnegatives, but only decreased the number of OGTTs performed by 7.2%. The authors conclude that \"adoption of HbA1c as a screening test for GDM may\neliminate the need of OGTT.\" Although the HbA1c test does not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as the sole diagnostic test, \"the use\nof a rule-out strategy in combination with the OGTT could be useful.\"\nHowever, the use of hemoglobin A1c testing is not useful in predicting all forms of dysglycemia. Tommerdahl, et al. (2019) evaluated several biomarkers\nfor their accuracy in screening for cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes. These biomarkers included \u201chemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 1,5-anhydroglucitol\n(1,5AG), fructosamine (FA), and glycated albumin (GA)\u201d and were compared to the current gold standard, OGTT 2-hour glucose. Fifty-eight patients with\nCF were included and \u201carea under the receiver operative characteristic (ROC-AUC) curves were generated.\u201d All ROC-AUCs for each biomarker were\n\u201clow\u201d both for cystic fibrosis-related prediabetes (CFPD, ROC-AUC 0.52-0.67) and CF-related diabetes (CFRD) (0.56-0.61). For CFRD, HbA1c was\nmeasured to have a 78% sensitivity and 41% specificity at a cutoff of 5.5%, which corresponds to a ROC-AUC of 0.61. The authors concluded that \u201cAll\nalternate markers tested demonstrate poor diagnostic accuracy for identifying CFRD by 2hG.\u201d\nIn a retrospective review of the UMass Memorial Health System electronic medical records from between 1997 and 2019, Darukhanavala, et al. (2021)\nevaluated the appropriateness of HbA1c as a screening tool for identifying patients with pre-CFRD dysglycemia to minimize the burden of annual two-\nhour OGTTs. The study included 56 patients categorized according to OGTT results (American Diabetes Association criteria): normal glucose tolerance\n(n=34), indeterminant glycemia (INDET, n=6), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, n=7), or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n=9). It was found that HbA1c\nwas positively correlated with blood glucose levels at the various time cut points (hour zero, hour one, and hour two), though the associations were\nquite weak (r = 0.248, r = 0.219, and r = 0.369, respectively). Furthermore, t-tests conducted suggested that the mean HbA1c was not significantly\ndifferent between patients with normal glucose tolerance and those in the INDET (p = 0.987), IFG (p = 0.690), and IGT (p = 0.874) groups, confirmed by\nANOVA (p = 0.250). Consequently, the authors reported that the \u201cresults do not support the use of HbA1c as a possible screening tool for pre-CFRD\ndysglycemic states, specifically INDET, IFG, and IGT.\u201d\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n5/15\nBy combining administrative datasets from the Veterans Health Administration and Medicare, Zhao, et al. (2021) evaluated the impact of hemoglobin\nA1c (A1c) variability\u2014the CV, described by A1c standard deviation divided by the average A1c value overall and expressed as a percent\u2014on the risk of\nhypoglycemia-related hospitalization (HRH) in veterans with diabetes mellitus. In this study sample of 342,059 patients, the authors identified a\n\u201cconsistent and positive relationship between A1c variability and HRH\u201d and noted that \u201cAverage A1c levels were also significantly and independently\nassociated with HRH, with levels <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) associated with lower risk and levels >9% (75 mmol/mol) conferring greater risk.\u201d Due to these\ndifferent levels of variability all remaining strong predictors of HRH risk up to three years following the baseline period, authors concluded that \u201ctracking\nA1c levels alone may be insufficient to mitigate risk.\u201d It was also acknowledged that a few limitations affected the generalizability of the study, such as\nthe lack of socioeconomic data, the study sample being predominantly white males, and including only veterans, the latter of which is a population\nwhere comorbidities are more prevalent. Consequently, these data may be reflective of \u201cthe complex interplay of disease severity, treatment, and\nsociodemographic factors,\u201d as is the case with other clinical findings.\nWhile poor outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) have been linked to diabetes, its relation to pre\u2010infection glycemic control is still unclear.\nBecause of this, Merzon, et al. (2021) investigated the association between pre\u2010infection HemoglobinA1c (A1C) levels and COVID\u201019 severity as\nassessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients (ages 14 to 103) with diabetes tested for COVID\u201019 in Leumit Health Services, Israel,\nbetween February 1 and April 30, 2020. Of the patients in this cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. A comparison of the mean HbA1c of\nthose who were COVID-19 positive (7.19%, 95% CI: 6.81%-7.57%) and the mean of those who were COVID-19 negative (6.59%, 95% CI: 6.52%-6.65%)\nwas found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). The authors expounded further by reporting the clinical characteristics of patients with diabetes\nhospitalized due to COVID-19 by demonstrating that the mean Hb1Ac levels between those hospitalized (n=46, 7.75%, 95% CI: 7.17%-8.32%) and those\nnot hospitalized (n=137, 6.83%, 95% CI: 6.54%-7.13%) were also statistically significant (p<0.005). Additionally, \u201cIn a multivariate logistic regression\nmodel adjusting for multiple potential risk factors and chronic conditions which may have a deleterious effect on disease outcomes (including age, sex,\nsmoking, IHD, SES, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, CVA, CHF, chronic lung disease, and obesity), only HbA1c \u2265 nine\npercent remained a significant predictor for hospitalization.\u201d Given the evidence, the researchers\u00a0urge \u201cPaying special attention to patients with\ndiabetes and an HbA1c \u2265 nine while allowing a more lenient approach to patients with well controlled disease,\u201d as this can reduce economic, social, and\npatient burden, especially for those who are at the greatest risk for reacting severely to COVID-19.\nXie, et al. (2021) investigated the role of FPG and glucose fluctuation on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients who already had prior diagnoses of\ndiabetes. Through a multivariate Cox analysis, the researchers found that FPG was \u201can independent prognostic factor of overall survival after\nadjustment for age, sex, diabetes, and severity of COVID-19 at admission (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25).\u201d However, blood glucose fluctuation was\nassociated with COVID-19 disease progression, as proven by the results found from the indices of the standard deviation of blood glucose and the\nlargest amplitude of glycemic excursions. Both FPG and blood glucose fluctuation indices were also found to be positively associated with increased\npresence of inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19, such as the \u201cwhite blood cell absolute count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, alkaline\nphosphatase, a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-hbdh), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase, [and] D-dimer.\u201d Ultimately, it was\nconcluded that diabetes was not an independent risk factor for in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients, as these findings were identified regardless of\ndiabetes status.\nYang, et al. (2019) aimed to find the appropriate threshold for FPG for defining prediabetes among children and adolescents. The sample was selected\nfrom school-aged children in Taiwan via a nationwide survey administered between 1992-2000, who then underwent physical examinations and blood\ntests if they exhibited abnormal urine test findings. The researchers found that the incidence of pediatric diabetes increased with increasing fasting\nplasma glucose levels, and those with FPG > 5.6mmol/L had higher adjusted hazard ratios. Additionally, \u201cthe association between fasting plasma\nglucose and incident pediatric diabetes and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were similar in boys and girls and were higher in\nthe age group twelve to eighteen years.\u201d In using 4.75 mmol/L as the optimal threshold for children six to eleven years, the sensitivity was 65% and\nspecificity was 51%. For the threshold of 5.19 mmol/L among children twelve to eighteen years, the sensitivity was 60% and the specificity was 73%.\nThis supports utilizing FPG as a supplement for diagnosing prediabetes among pediatric patients, which may contribute to better disease management.\nGeifman-Holtzman, et al. (2010) assessed the correlation between fetal macrosomia and abnormal OGTT in pregnant individuals with term gestation and\nnegative glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24 to 28 weeks. They recruited patients who had estimated fetal weights >90th percentile and a negative 50g\nGCT. From 170 individuals over a five-month period, they found that 10 patients or 5.9% had \u201cimpaired glucose metabolism at term.\u201d In this group, \u201cwe\nfound no correlation between GCT values at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks, family history of diabetes mellitus, the patient\u2019s [body mass index] or\nweight at term, and the diagnosis of impaired glucose metabolism.\u201d Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in mean fetal weight\nbetween those with normal versus abnormal OGTT. This demonstrated the lack of clinical utility of using OGTT at term for predicting the incidence of\nfetal macrosomia. The researchers suggested utilizing a larger scale study to solidify or contradict these conclusions.\nBi, et al. (2024) engaged in a cross-sectional study of participants aged >20 years old who underwent physical examination at the local hospital from\n2022 to 2023. A model was used to assess the dose-response relationship between liver enzymes and type 2 diabetes risk. Of the 14,100 participants,\nan analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between liver enzymes and\u00a0type 2 diabetes risk (P non-linear < 0.001). Specifically, type 2 diabetes risk\nincreased with rising ALT and GGT levels (range, <50 IU/L) and then leveled out when ALT and GGT levels were >50 IU/L. An elevated AST within a\ncertain range (range, <35 IU/L) decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes, but a mildly elevated AST (>35 IU/L) showed as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\nIn conclusion, liver enzymes were associated non-linearly with type 2 diabetes risk in different populations. Higher ALT and GGT levels were shown in\nthis study to increase type 2 diabetes risk as well. In conclusion, additional attention should be paid to elevated liver enzymes and diabetes, but more\nwork also needs to be done to assess association between elevation and T2D risk.\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA)\nThe ADA publishes an extensive guideline encompassing the standards of medical care in diabetes.

Grade B\u201d\n\u201cConsider screening people for prediabetes or diabetes if on certain medications, such as glucocorticoids, statins, thiazide diuretics, some HIV\nmedications, and second-generation antipsychotic medications, as these agents are known to increase the risk of these conditions. Grade E\u201d\n\u201cIn people who are prescribed second-generation antipsychotic medications, screen for prediabetes and diabetes at baseline and repeat 12\u201316\nweeks after medication initiation or sooner, if clinically indicated, and annually. Grade B\u201d\n\u201cPeople with HIV should be screened for diabetes and prediabetes with an FPG test before starting antiretroviral therapy, at the time of switching\nantiretroviral therapy, and 3\u20136 months after starting or switching antiretroviral therapy. If initial screening results are normal, FPG should be\nchecked annually. Grade E\u201d\nChildren & Adolescents (Ch 14)\nThe traditional idea of type 2 diabetes occurring only in adults and type 1 diabetes occurring only in children is no longer accurate, as both\ndiseases can occur in both age-groups. The recommendations concerning diabetes testing for children and adolescents are as follows:\n\u201cRisk-based screening for prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or \u226510 years of age, whichever\noccurs earlier, in youth with overweight (BMI \u226585th percentile) or obesity (BMI \u226595th percentile) and who have one or more additional risk factors\nfor diabetes.\u201d46 Grading based on risk factors;\nMaternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child's gestation-Grade A\nFamily history of type 2 diabetes in first- or second-degree relative-Grade A\nRace/ethnicity (Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American, Pacific Islander)-Grade A\nSigns of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary\nsyndrome, or small-for-gestational-age birth weight)-Grade B.\n\u201cIf tests are normal, repeat screening at a minimum of 3-year intervals [Grade E], or more frequently if BMI is increasing [Grade C].\u201d\n\u201cFasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and A1c can be used to test for prediabetes or [type 2]\ndiabetes in children and adolescents.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cChildren and adolescents with overweight or obesity in whom the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is being considered should have a panel of\npancreatic autoantibodies tested to exclude the possibility of autoimmune type 1 diabetes.\u201d Grade B\n8,46\n2\n2\n46\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n7/15\n\u201cAlthough A1c is not recommended for diagnosis of diabetes in children with cystic fibrosis or symptoms suggestive of acute onset of type 1\ndiabetes and only A1c assays without interference are appropriate for children with hemoglobinopathies, ADA continues to recommend A1c for\ndiagnosis of type 2 diabetes in this population (ungraded)\u201d\n\u201cA1C goals must be individualized and reassessed over time. An A1C of <7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate for many children\u201d Grade B.\nPregnancy (Ch 15)\n\u201c\u2026although A1c may be useful, it should be used as a secondary measure of glycemic control in pregnancy, after blood glucose monitoring.\u201d\n\u201cFasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring are recommended in individuals with diabetes in pregnancy to achieve optimal\nglucose levels. Glucose goals are fasting plasma glucose <95 mg/dL (<5.3 mmol/L) and either 1-h postprandial glucose <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L)\nor 2-h postprandial glucose <120 mg/dL (<6.7 mmol/L) Grade B\u201d\n\u201cDue to increased red blood cell turnover, A1C is slightly lower during pregnancy in people with and without diabetes. Ideally, the A1C goal in\npregnancy is <6% (<42 mmol/mol) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, but the goal may be relaxed to <7% (<53 mmol/mol) if\nnecessary to prevent hypoglycemia Grade B\u201d\n\u201cGiven the alteration in red blood cell kinetics during pregnancy and physiological changes in glycemic parameters, A1c levels may need \u201cto be\nmonitored more frequently than usual (e.g., monthly).\u201d\n\u201cThe OGTT is recommended over A1C at four to twelve weeks postpartum because A1C may be persistently impacted (lowered) by the increased\nred blood cell turnover related to pregnancy, by blood loss at delivery, or by the preceding three-month glucose profile. The OGTT is more\nsensitive at detecting glucose intolerance, including both prediabetes and diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cBecause GDM often represents previously undiagnosed prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, or even developing\ntype 1 diabetes, individuals with GDM should be tested for persistent diabetes or prediabetes at four to twelve weeks postpartum with a fasting\n75-g OGTT using nonpregnancy criteria as outlined in Section two, \u201cClassification and Diagnosis of Diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, a positive screen for diabetes requires two abnormal values. If both the fasting plasma glucose\n(\u2265126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L]) and 2-h plasma glucose (\u2265200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]) are abnormal in a single screening test, then the diagnosis of\ndiabetes is made. If only one abnormal value in the OGTT meets diabetes criteria, the test should be repeated to confirm that the abnormality\npersists.\u201d\n\u201cIndividuals with a history of GDM should have ongoing screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes every 1\u20133 years, even if the results of the\ninitial 4\u201312 week postpartum 75-g OGTT are normal. Ongoing evaluation may be performed with any recommended glycemic test (e.g., annual\nA1C, annual fasting plasma glucose, or triennial 75-g OGTT using thresholds for nonpregnant individuals).\u201d\nHeart Failure Considerations (ch. 10)\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals, routine screening for coronary artery disease is not recommended, as it does not improve outcomes as long as\nASCVD risk factors are treated.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cConsider investigations for coronary artery disease in the presence of any of the following: atypical cardiac symptoms; signs or symptoms of\nassociated vascular disease, including carotid bruits, transient ischemic attack, stroke, claudication, or PAD; or electrocardiogram abnormalities\n(e.g., Q waves).\u201d Grade E\n\u201cAdults with diabetes are at increased risk for the development of asymptomatic cardiac structural or functional abnormalities (stage B heart\nfailure) or symptomatic (stage C) heart failure. Consider screening adults with diabetes by measuring a natriuretic peptide (B-type natriuretic\npeptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-BNP [NTproBNP]) to facilitate prevention of stage C heart failure.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and abnormal natriuretic peptide levels, echocardiography is recommended to identify stage B heart\nfailure.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and age \u226550 years, microvascular disease in any location, or foot complications or any end-organ\ndamage from diabetes, screening for PAD with ankle-brachial index testing is recommended to guide treatment for cardiovascular disease\nprevention and limb preservation. A In individuals with diabetes duration \u226510 years, screening for PAD should be considered\u201d Grade B.\nNonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis & Chronic Kidney Disease (ch. 4 and ch. 11)\nFrom chapter 4:\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, particularly those with obesity or cardiometabolic risk factors or established cardiovascular disease,\nshould be screened/risk stratified for clinically significant liver fibrosis (defined as moderate fibrosis to cirrhosis) using a calculated fibrosis-4\nindex (FIB-4) (derived from age, ALT, AST, and platelets\u2026even if they have normal liver enzymes.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with diabetes or prediabetes with persistently elevated plasma aminotransferase levels for >6 months and low FIB-4 should be evaluated\nfor other causes of liver disease.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with an indeterminate or high FIB-4 should have additional risk stratification by liver stiffness\nmeasurement with transient elastography or the blood biomarker enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF).\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with indeterminate results or at high risk for significant liver fibrosis (i.e., by FIB-4, liver stiffness\nmeasurement, or ELF) should be referred to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for further workup. Interprofessional care is recommended for\nlong-term management Grade B.\u201d\nFrom chapter 11:\nAdditionally: \u201cA screening strategy based on elevated plasma aminotransferases >40 units/L would miss most individuals with NASH in these settings,\nas clinically significant fibrosis (\u2265F2) is frequently observed with plasma aminotransferases below the commonly used cutoff of 40 units/L. The American\nCollege of Gastroenterology considers the upper limit of normal ALT levels to be 29\u201333 units/L for male individuals and 19\u201325 units/L for female\nindividuals, as higher levels are associated with increased liver-related mortality, even in the absence of identifiable risk factors. The FIB-4 estimates\nthe risk of hepatic cirrhosis and is calculated from the computation of age, plasma aminotransferases (AST and ALT), and platelet count.\u201d\nIn regards to A1c and NASH, the ADA restricts its comments to the following: \u201cThe only proven primary prevention interventions for CKD in people with\ndiabetes are blood glucose (A1C goal of 7%) and blood pressure control (blood pressure <130/80 mmHg),\u201d and \u201cIntensive lowering of blood glucose with\nthe goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large, randomized studies to delay the onset and progression of albuminuria and reduce\neGFR in people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Insulin alone was used to lower blood glucose in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial\n(DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study of type 1 diabetes, while a variety of agents were used in clinical trials of type\n2 diabetes, supporting the conclusion that lowering blood glucose itself helps prevent CKD and its progression. The effects of glucose-lowering\ntherapies on CKD have helped define A1C goals.\u201d\nHospital Care Delivery Standards and Perioperative Care (ch. 16)\n49\n50\n51\n52,53\n54\n54\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n8/15\n\u201cPerform an A1C test on all people with diabetes or hyperglycemia (random blood glucose >140 mg/dL [>7.8 mmol/L]) admitted to the hospital if\nno A1C test result is available from the prior 3 months.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn hospitalized individuals with diabetes who are eating, point-of-care (POC) blood glucose monitoring should be performed before meals; in\nthose not eating, glucose monitoring is advised every 4\u20136 h. More frequent POC blood glucose monitoring ranging from every 30 min to every 2 h\nis the required standard for safe use of intravenous insulin therapy.\u201d (No grade; statement)\nThe following approach may be considered for those in preoperative and perioperative care:\n\u201cA preoperative risk assessment should be performed for people with diabetes who are at high risk for ischemic heart disease and those with\nautonomic neuropathy or renal failure.\nThe A1C goal for elective surgeries should be <8% (<63.9 mmol/L) whenever possible.\nThe blood glucose goal in the perioperative period should be 100\u2013180 mg/dL (5.6\u201310.0 mmol/L) within 4 h of the surgery. CGM should not be\nused alone for glucose monitoring during surgery.\nMetformin should be held on the day of surgery.\nSGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued 3\u20134 days before surgery.\nHold other oral glucose-lowering agents the morning of surgery or procedure and give one-half of NPH dose or 75\u201380% doses of long-acting\nanalog insulin or adjust insulin pump basal rates based on the type of diabetes and clinical judgment.\nMonitor blood glucose at least every 2\u20134 h while the individual takes nothing by mouth and dose with short- or rapid-acting insulin as needed.\nThere is little data on the safe use and/or influence of GLP-1 receptor agonists on glycemia and delayed gastric emptying in the perioperative\nperiod.\nStricter perioperative glycemic goals are not advised, as perioperative glycemic goals stricter than 80\u2013180 mg/dL (4.4\u201310.0 mmol/L) may not\nimprove outcomes and are associated with more hypoglycemia.\nCompared with usual dosing, a reduction by 25% of basal insulin given the evening before surgery is more likely to achieve perioperative blood\nglucose goals with a lower risk for hypoglycemia.\nIn individuals undergoing noncardiac general surgery, basal insulin plus premeal short- or rapid-acting insulin (basal-bolus) coverage has been\nassociated with improved glycemic outcomes and lower rates of perioperative complications compared with the reactive, correction-only short- or\nrapid-acting insulin coverage alone with no basal insulin dosing.\u201d\nThe ADA did not specifically mention \u201cbariatric surgery\u201d in their hospital care delivery section (ch. 16).\nDiabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee\nThis Expert Committee published a comprehensive guideline on the prevention and management of diabetes. Relevant items, recommendations, and\ncomments\u2014particularly those relating to the use of A1c testing\u2014are captured below:\n\u201cScreen for type 2 diabetes using a fasting plasma glucose and/or glycated hemoglobin (A1C) every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or\nin individuals at high risk on a risk calculator (33% chance of developing diabetes over ten years).\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of evidence for interventions to prevent or delay type 1 diabetes, routine screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended.\u201d\n\u201cFor most individuals with diabetes, A1C should be measured approximately every three months to ensure that glycemic goals are being met or\nmaintained. In some circumstances, such as when significant changes are made to therapy, or during pregnancy, it is appropriate to check A1C\nmore frequently. Testing at least every six months should be performed in adults during periods of treatment and healthy behavior stability when\nglycemic targets have been consistently achieved.\u201d\nA1C can be misleading in various medical conditions (\u201ce.g., hemoglobinopathies, iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia, severe hepatic or renal\ndisease\u201d) and should not be used for \u201cdiagnostic use in children and adolescents (as the sole diagnostic test), pregnant [individuals] as part of\nroutine screening for gestational diabetes, those with cystic fibrosis or those with suspected type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nDiabetes \u201cshould\u201d be diagnosed at a level of A1C \u22656.5%.\n\u201cScreening for diabetes using FPG and/or A1C should be performed every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or at high risk using a risk\ncalculator [Grade D, Consensus]. Earlier testing and/or more frequent follow up (every six to twelve months) with either FPG and/or A1C should\nbe considered in those at very high risk using a risk calculator or in people with additional risk factors for diabetes [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d\nIt should be mentioned that \u201cGlycemic targets should be individualized [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d based upon various considerations including, but not\nlimited to, the patient\u2019s functional dependence, medical history, life expectancy, and life course stage. Moreover, the grading of recommendations above\n(e.g., \u201cGrade D\u201d) reflect the methodological rigor used at arriving at the conclusion, such that lower grades reflect the presence of weaker evidence. But\nthough the \u201cpaucity of clinical evidence addressing the areas of therapy, prevention, diagnosis or prognosis precluded the assignment of a higher\ngrade,\u201d the authors recognize and note that many Grade D recommendations are \u201cvery important to the contemporary management of diabetes.\u201d\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)\nThe USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who are overweight or obese, and such\n\u201cScreening tests for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes include measurement of fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c level or an oral glucose tolerance test.\u201d\nRecognizing that \u201cThe optimal screening interval for adults with an initial normal glucose test result is uncertain,\u201d the USPSTF suggests that \u201cScreening\nevery three years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels.\u201d\nThe USPSTF has also provided guidelines pertaining to the screening of gestational diabetes. For asymptomatic pregnant persons at 24 weeks\ngestation or after, with a letter \u201cB\u201d grade, the USPSTF recommends screening for gestational diabetes in this population. However, in asymptomatic\npregnant persons before 24 weeks gestation, the USPSTF states that \u201ccurrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of\nscreening\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nAn \u201cI\u201d grade is defined by the USPSTF as \u201cI Statement- The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits\nand harms cannot be determined.\u201d\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n9/15\nIn 2022, the USPSTF released its first recommendation on screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. This recommendation applies to\nchildren and adolescents who are not pregnant and who are younger than 18 years of age without known diabetes or prediabetes and who are without\nsymptoms of diabetes or prediabetes. The USPSTF states that the goal of screening for type 2 diabetes in young people is \u201cto diagnose and treat it\nearly to prevent development of bad health outcomes. However, no studies have looked at the link between screening for type 2 diabetes in children and\nadolescents and bad health outcomes. Studies about the effect of type 2 diabetes treatment on health outcomes in children and adolescents have not\nhad enough patients with bad outcomes to draw any meaningful conclusions. No studies have looked at harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in young\npeople. Potential harms may include side effects from medications used to treat diabetes, such as low blood glucose, nausea, or vomiting.\u201d Based on\nthe current evidence for asymptomatic children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age, the USPSTF concluded that \u201ccurrent evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)\nThe Global Report on Diabetes states that: \u201cGlycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the method of choice for monitoring glycaemic control in diabetes. An\nadvantage of using HbA1c is that the patient does not need to be in a fasting state. Ideally it should be measured twice a year in people\u00a0with type 2\ndiabetes and more frequently in those with type 1 diabetes. However, HbA1c testing is more costly than glucose measurement, and therefore less\nreadily available. If HbA1c testing is not available, fasting, or post-meal blood glucose is an acceptable substitute.\u201d\nThe WHO also published a \u201cmodule\u201d titled \u201cHearts-D: Diagnosis and Management of Type 2 Diabetes in 2020. In it, a testing algorithm for \u201ctreatment of\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin\u201d is included at the bottom. The algorithm calls for an HbA1c assessment to be performed \u201cin three months\u201d if the\npatient is stabilized as a result of the insulin treatment.\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)\nIn 2022, the AAFP published a clinical summary of the USPSTF recommendation for screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The\ndocument deferred to the USPSTF recommendations, with the testing audience being \u201cNonpregnant adults aged thirty-five to seventy years who have\noverweight or obesity and no symptoms of diabetes\u201d\u2014a move from 40 years of age in the previous recommendation\u2014while deeming screening every\nthree years to be a reasonable approach.\nEndocrine Society\nThe Endocrine Society published this guideline regarding management of diabetes in older adults. In it, they recommend screening for prediabetes or\ndiabetes every two years for patients 65 years or older. FPG and/or HbA1c may be used. However, the Society does recommend caution when\ninterpreting HbA1c results, as older patients are more likely to have conditions that alter red blood cell turnover.\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\nNICE published an update to their guideline on diabetes management. In it, they make the following recommendations:\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c levels in adults with type 2 diabetes every:\nThree to six months (tailored to individual needs) until HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy.\nSix months once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable.\u201d\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c using methods calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardization.\u201d\n\u201cIf HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type, estimate trends in blood glucose control using\none of the following:\nquality-controlled plasma glucose profiles\ntotal glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)\nfructosamine estimation.\u201d\n\u201cInvestigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes\nor clinical biochemistry.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)\nThe AACE provides the following inclusion criteria for individuals who should be screened for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes:\nAge \u226545 years without other risk factors\nCVD or family history of T2D\nOverweight or obese\nSedentary lifestyle\nMember of an at-risk racial or ethnic group:\nAsian\nAfrican American\nHispanic\nNative American (Alaska Natives and American Indians)\nPacific Islander\nHigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level >250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L)\nImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and/or metabolic syndrome\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), acanthosis nigricans, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\nHypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg or on antihypertensive therapy)\nHistory of gestational diabetes or delivery of a baby weighing more than 5 kg (9 lb)\nAntipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia and/or severe bipolar disease\nChronic glucocorticoid exposure\nSleep disorders in the presence of glucose intolerance (A1C >5.7%, IGT, or IFG on previous testing), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),\nchronic sleep deprivation, and night-shift occupation\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n10/15\nThe AACE recommends repeat testing at least every three years for individuals with normal results. Consider annual screening for patients with two or\nmore risk factors.\nIn a 2022 update focusing on developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan, the AACE expounds on how the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus\nshould be made. According to the authors, the ELs refer to evidence levels established by AACE evidence ratings, where \u201cdescriptors of \u201cmust,\u201d\n\u201cshould,\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d generally but not strictly correlate with Grade A (strong), Grade B (intermediate), and Grade C (weak) recommendations,\nrespectively.\u201d\nThe relevant recommendations are captured below.\n\u201cRecommendation 1.1\nThe diagnosis of DM is based on the following criteria\u2026:\nFPG concentration \u2265126 mg/dL (after \u2265 eight hours of an overnight fast), or\nPlasma glucose (PG) concentration \u2265200 mg/dL two hours after ingesting a 75-g oral glucose load after an overnight fast of at least eight hours,\nor\nSymptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia) and a random (nonfasting) PG concentration \u2265200 mg/dL, or\nA1C level \u22656.5%\nDiagnosis of DM requires two abnormal test results, either from the same sample or two abnormal results on samples drawn on different days. However,\na glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms for DM confirms the diagnosis of DM.\nGrade A; BEL 2 and expert opinion of task force\nRecommendation 1.2\nPrediabetes is identified by the presence of IFG (100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), which is a PG value of 140 to 199 mg/dL two\nhours after ingesting 75 g of glucose, and/or A1C value between 5.7% and 6.4% (Table 4). A1C should be used only for screening for prediabetes. The\ndiagnosis of prediabetes, which may manifest as either IFG or IGT, should be confirmed with glucose testing.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.3\nT1D is characterized by marked insulin deficiency in the presence of hyperglycemia and positive autoantibody tests to glutamic acid decarboxylase\n(GAD65), pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells (tyrosine phosphatase IA-2), and IA-2b zinc transporter (ZnT8), and/or insulin. The presence of immune markers and\nclinical presentation are needed to establish the correct diagnosis and to distinguish between T1D and T2D in children or adults, as well as to determine\nappropriate treatment.\nGrade A; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.4\nT2D is characterized by progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion and variable defects in insulin sensitivity. T2D is often asymptomatic and can remain\nundiagnosed for many years; therefore, all adults \u226535 years of age with risk factors should be screened for DM (Table 5).\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.5\nGDM is defined as carbohydrate intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy and resolves postpartum. Pregnant individuals with risk\nfactors for DM should be screened at the first prenatal visit for undiagnosed T2D using standard criteria (Table 4).\nGrade B; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.6\nScreen all pregnant individuals for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Diagnose GDM with either the one-step or the two-step\napproach.\nThe one-step approach uses a two-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after \u2265 eight hours of fasting with diagnostic cutoffs of one or\nmore FPG \u226592 mg/dL, one-hour PG \u2265180 mg/dL, or two-hour PG \u2265153 mg/dL.\nThe two-step approach uses a nonfasting one-hour 50-g glucose challenge test with one-hour PG screening threshold of 130 or 140 mg/dL. For\nindividuals with a positive screening test, the three-hour 100-g OGTT is used for diagnosis with two or more PG tests that meet the following\nthresholds: FPG \u226595 mg/dL, 1-hour \u2265180 mg/dL, 2-hour \u2265155 mg/dL, 3-hour \u2265140 mg/dL.\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.7\nClinicians should consider evaluation for monogenic DM in any child or young adult with an atypical presentation, clinical course, or response to\ntherapy. Monogenic DM includes neonatal diabetes and nonautoimmune diabetes of multiple genetic causes, also known as maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young (MODY). Most children with DM occurring under six months of age have a monogenic cause as autoimmune T1D rarely occurs before six\nmonths of age. Other monogenic forms of diabetes are characterized by mutation of genes of transcription factors, genes regulating pancreatic\ndevelopment or atrophy, abnormal insulin genes, genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress that impair insulin secretion, or abnormal glucokinase\ngenes that cause impaired insulin signaling.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nAlthough not expressly listed as recommendations for diabetes screening, some additional information of note includes the following:\n\u201cA glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of hyperglycemia symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia confirm the diagnosis of DM. In\nindividuals with discordant results from two different tests, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated on a different\nday.\u201d\n\u201cIn view of physiological changes in pregnancy that could affect glycated hemoglobin levels, A1C should not be used for GDM screening or\ndiagnosis of DM.\u201d\n66\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n11/15\n\u201cAll pregnant individuals should be screened for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Universal screening is recommended, as\nselective screening (only in individuals with risk factors) would miss a significant number of individuals with GDM and universal screening has\nbeen shown to be cost-effective compared with selective screening.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE)\nThe 2020 Consensus Statement from the AACE/ACE on the Management of Type 2 Diabetes states:\n\"The hemoglobin A1c (A1c) target should be individualized based on numerous factors such as age, life expectancy, comorbid conditions,\nduration of diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia or adverse consequences from hypoglycemia, patient motivation, and adherence.\"\n\u201cAn A1c level of \u22646.5% is considered optimal if it can be achieved in a safe and affordable manner, but higher targets may be appropriate for\ncertain individuals and may change for a given individual over time.\u201d\n\u201cTherapy must be evaluated frequently (e.g., every three months) until stable using multiple criteria, including A1c, SMBG records (fasting and\npostprandial) or continuous glucose monitoring tracings, documented and suspected hypoglycemia events, lipid and BP values, adverse events\n(weight gain, fluid retention, hepatic or renal impairment, or CVD), comorbidities, other relevant laboratory data, concomitant drug administration,\ncomplications of diabetes, and psychosocial factors affecting patient care. Less frequent monitoring is acceptable once targets are achieved.\u201d\nIn 2023, the AACE/ACE released \u201cGuidelines and Recommendations for Laboratory Analysis in the Diagnosis and Management of Diabetes Mellitus.\u201d\nDiagnosis related recommendations:\n\u201cFasting glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used to establish the diagnosis of diabetes, with a value \u22657.0 mmol/L (\u2265126 mg/dL)\ndiagnostic of diabetes. A (high)\u201d\nScreening related recommendations:\n\u201cRecommendation: Screening by HbA1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT is recommended for individuals who are at high risk of diabetes. If HbA1c is <5.7%\n(<39 mmol/mol), FPG is <5.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL), and/or 2-h plasma glucose is <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year\nintervals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used for screening of high-risk individuals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Plasma glucose should be measured in an accredited laboratory when used for diagnosis of or screening for diabetes. GPP\n(good practice point)\u201d\nMonitoring/Prognosis:\n\u201cRecommendation: Routine measurement of plasma glucose concentrations in a laboratory is not recommended as the primary means of\nmonitoring or evaluating therapy in individuals with diabetes. B (moderate)\u201d\nKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Diabetes Working Group\nThe KDIGO group published recommendations on diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). They recommend using HbA1c to monitor diabetic and\nCKD patients twice a year or as often as four times a year if glycemic target is not met or a change is made in therapy. KDIGO advises that \"accuracy\nand precision of HbA1c measurement declines with advanced CKD, particularly among patients treated by dialysis, in whom HbA1c measurements have\nlow reliability.\" They also recommend an \"individualized HbA1c target ranging from <6.5% to <8.0% in patients with diabetes and CKD not treated with\ndialysis.\u201d\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a condition where there is a buildup of fat in the liver. It is seen in individuals who\ndrink little to no alcohol but who have\u00a0diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. Diabetes is both a possible cause of and or symptom\nof MASLD: while diabetes is a risk factor for developing MASLD, individuals who have been diagnosed with MASLD may be at risk for developing heart\ndisease and diabetes.",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\nPrevalence: In 2021, 38.4 million Americans, or 11.6% of the population, had diabetes. Approximately 1.9 million American children and adults\nhave type 1 diabetes, including about 244,000 children and adolescents.\nDiagnosed and undiagnosed: Of the 38.4 million, 29.7 million were diagnosed, and 8.7 million were undiagnosed.\nPrevalence in seniors: The percentage of Americans aged 65 and older remains high, at 29.2%, or 15.9 million seniors (diagnosed and\nundiagnosed).\nNew cases: 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year.\nPrediabetes: In 2021, 97.6 million Americans aged eighteen and older had prediabetes.\nDeaths: Diabetes remains the 8th leading cause of death in the United States in 2021, with 103,294 death certificates listing it as the underlying\ncause of death, and a total of 399.401 death certificates listing diabetes as a cause of death.\nTotal economic cost of diabetes care in the United States: $413 billion in 2022.\nDiabetes can be classified into the following categories:\n\u201cType 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune \u03b2-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency)\u201d\n\u201cType 2 diabetes (due to a progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background of insulin resistance)\u201d\n\u201cGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior\nto gestation)\u201d\n\u201cSpecific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young [MODY]), diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as\nwith glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, or after organ transplantation)\u201d  The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is easily established\nwhen a patient presents with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, which include polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, blurred vision, and, infrequently,\nweight loss. The frequency of symptomatic diabetes has been decreasing in parallel with improved efforts to diagnose diabetes earlier through\nscreening. Increasingly, the majority of patients are asymptomatic, and hyperglycemia is noted on routine laboratory evaluation, prompting further\ntesting.\n6,7\n8\n3\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n3/15\nGlycated hemoglobin A1c (also known as HbA1c, A1c, glycohemoglobin, or hemoglobin A1c) testing plays a key role in the management of diabetes.\nNew hemoglobin enters circulation with minimal glucose attached. However, glucose irreversibly binds to hemoglobin based on the surrounding blood\nglucose concentration. Therefore, A1c is considered a measure of blood glucose level, albeit an indirect one. It is best correlated with the mean glucose\nlevel over the last eight to twelve weeks as red blood cells experience significant turnover. Various factors may affect the reliability of A1c (atypical\nhemoglobins or hemoglobinopathies, chronic kidney disease, et al.), but most assays have been standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications\nTrial (DCCT) standard, which \u201cestimated the mean blood glucose concentrations derived from seven measurements a day (before and ninety minutes\nafter each of the three major\u00a0meals, and before bedtime), performed once every three months and compared the average glucose concentration with\nA1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nThe HbA1c assay provides information about the degree of long-term glucose control,  and has been recommended for the diagnosis and monitoring of\ndiabetes.\nVarious methods of HbA1c measurement include chromatography based HPLC assay, boronate affinity, antibody-based immunoassay, and\nenzyme based enzymatic assay.\nLong-term blood sugar control has been associated with decreased risk of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and\ncardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial, cerebrovascular disease,\nand myocardial fibrosis in adults with diabetes.\nHigher HbA1c variability has\nbeen associated with higher all-cause mortality in patients with Type 2 Diabetes.\nFasting plasma glucose is a method of glucose monitoring that measures an individual\u2019s glucose level typically in a period defined with no caloric intake\nfor eight hours or more. Its usage in the diagnosis of diabetes lies primarily in gestational diabetes, along with the OGTT, but HbA1c, FPG, or OGTTs\nwith their respective positive results can be used in diagnosing diabetes mellitus in nonpregnant individuals as well. To diagnose diabetes in\nasymptomatic individuals, a FPG has to be \u2265 126 mg/dL. For diagnosing prediabetes, an individual may have \u201cimpaired fasting glucose,\u201d which would\npresent with a range of 100-125 mg/Dl.\nTraditionally, the diagnosis of diabetes was predicated on plasma glucose levels as well as symptom presentation. In 2010, the ADA endorsed as a\n\u201creliable retrospective marker of blood glucose control over the past 6-8 weeks.\u201d The advantages of HbA1c testing include increased convenience,\nincreased stability and decreased variation in measurement. While the ADA 2023 guidelines gave precedence to FPG, the latest 2024 guideline\naddressed the vital importance of HbA1c for both diagnostic and screening purposes (for both diabetes and prediabetes care).\nThe ADA notes that there are areas where HbA1c is insufficient and plasma glucose levels are the preferred measurement: \u201cIn the presence of\nhemoglobin variants, pregnancy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and other conditions that might potentially interfere with accurate\nHbA1c measurements, plasma glucose levels are preferred. Furthermore, in situations where elevated blood glucose levels might not be consistently\napparent, the diagnosis of diabetes necessitates two abnormal test results (HbA1c and plasma glucose) either simultaneously or at different time points.\nIn such scenarios, alternative biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin emerge as viable options for monitoring glycemic status.\nFructosamine reflects the total pool of glycated serum proteins, mainly albumin, reflecting glycemic trends over a span of two to four weeks\u2014a relatively\nshorter duration compared to A1C. Although these biomarkers show a strong correlation and are associated with long-term complications based on\nepidemiological evidence, the empirical support for their application is not as robust as that for HbA1c.\u201d\nThe OGTT can be more inconvenient and used in the setting to diagnose GDM. Normally, 75g of glucose is ingested by the patient, and if the patient\nhas a two-hour plasma glucose value of \u2265200 mg/dL, a diagnosis of diabetes can be made. The test can also be performed at one-hour with 50g oral\nglucose, with positive GDM diagnostic results between 130-140 mg/dL as part of a two-step approach with the three-hour 100g test, which can be\ndiagnostic of GDM with two elevated values. For prediabetes with an accompanied \u201cimpaired glucose tolerance,\u201d a two-hour plasma glucose value\nbetween 140-199 mg/dL is used. However, the WHO requires an additional FPG <126 in addition to the two-hour plasma glucose value to establish\nimpaired glucose tolerance.\nAnalytical Validity\nThe International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Working Group on HbA1c Standardization has developed a reference\nmeasurement system and the measurement of HbA1c is currently well-standardized,\nand a sound reference system is in place to ensure continuity and\nstability of the analytical validity of HbA1c measurement.\nIn contrast, plasma glucose concentration remains difficult to assay with consistent\naccuracy.\nHbA1c has greater analytical stability (consistency with repetitive sample testing) and less day-to-day variability than either the fasting\nplasma glucose (FPG)or two-hour PG.\nFor any given individual, the HbA1c exhibits little short-term biologic variability; its coefficient of variation\n(CV) is 3.6%, compared to FPG (CV of 5.7%) and 2-h PG (CV of 16.6%).\nA sample proficiency testing survey performed by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and College of American Pathologists\n(CAP) evaluated the accuracy of A1c assays. The survey found that \u201cmethod-specific, between-laboratory CV\u2019s ranged from 0.7% to 4.0%\u201d and\n\u201capproximately 85% of laboratories are using methods with CVs <3% at all five HbA1c levels.\u201d The survey also noted the current pass limit was \u00b16%, but\nusing a pass rate of 97.1% to 98.0% of labs passed.\nClinical Utility and Validity\nTesting A1c, FPG, and 2-h PG measure different aspects of glycemia and are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1c \u22656.5% identifies fewer\nindividuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria; however, a recent study concluded that twelve percent of patients can be misclassified with\nrespect to diabetes diagnosis due to laboratory instrument error in measuring glucose.\nThe New Hoorn Study analyzed the diagnostic properties of the\nA1c, using OGTT as the diagnostic criterion.\nThe analysis suggested that an A1c of 5.8% had a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 91%. This\ncompares with specificity of 24% and sensitivity of 99% for the A1c cut point of 6.5%. On the other hand, the 6.5% cut point had a positive predictive\nvalue of 93%, compared with a positive predictive value of only 24% for a cut point of 5.8%.\nWhen using the reference diagnosis of diabetes being a two-hour blood glucose >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT, the specificity of FPG \u2265126\nmg/dL was >95% and sensitivity about 50%, with possibly lower sensitivities and specificities for individuals over 65 years.27 With the same OGTT\nreference, the specificity and sensitivity of an A1c \u22656.5%, as per diagnosis of diabetes, were reported as 79% and 44%, respectively.\nCowie, et al. (2010) \u201cexamined prevalence\u2019s of previously diagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes and high risk for diabetes using recently\nsuggested A1c criteria in the U.S. during 2003\u20132006. We compared these prevalence\u2019s to those in earlier surveys and those using glucose criteria.\u201d\n14,611 individuals were included (completed a household interview) and classified for diagnosed diabetes and by A1c, fasting, and 2-h glucose\nchallenge values. Diagnostic values for A1c were \u22656.5% for \u201cundiagnosed\u201d diabetes and 6%-6.5% for \u201chigh risk\u201d of diabetes. The authors found that by\nthese A1c diagnostic values, the \u201ccrude prevalence\u201d of diabetes in adults older than twenty years was 20.4 million, of which nineteen percent went\nundiagnosed based on A1c \u2265 6.5%. The authors then stated that the A1c criteria only diagnosed thirty percent of the undiagnosed diabetic group.\n5\n9\n8,10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n3,4\n15\n4,16\n17\n18\n19\n20,21\n22,23\n24\n25\n26\n22\n28\n29\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n4/15\nMamtora, et al. (2021) assessed the clinical utility of point-of-care (POC) HbA1c testing in the ophthalmology outpatient setting. Forty-nine patients with\ndiabetic retinopathy underwent POC HbA1c testing and blood pressure measurement. Of the 49 patients, 81.6% had POC readings above the\nrecommended HbA1c levels and only 16.3% of these patients were aware of their elevated HbA1c levels. Fourteen patients (33.3%) with high HbA1c\nreadings were referred to secondary diabetic services and 88.8% of patients felt like the test was useful. The authors suggest that POC HbA1c testing is\na \"cost-effective, reproducible and clinically significant tool for the management of diabetes in an outpatient ophthalmology setting, allowing the rapid\nrecognition of high-risk patients and appropriate referral to secondary diabetic services.\"\nGoodney, et al. (2016) evaluated the consistency of A1c testing of diabetes patients and its effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The study included\n1574415 Medicare patients with diabetes mellitus, and the consistency of testing was separated into three categories: \u201clow (testing in zero or one of\nthree years), medium (testing in two of three years), and high (testing in all three years).\u201d Approximately 70.2% of patients received high-consistency\ntesting, 17.6% received medium-consistency, and 12.2% received low-consistency. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) included \u201cdeath,\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, amputation, or the need for leg revascularization.\u201d Low-consistency patients was associated with death or other adverse\nevents (hazard ratio: 1.21). The authors concluded that \u201cconsistent annual hemoglobin A1c testing is associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular\noutcomes in this observational cohort of Medicare patients of diabetes mellitus.\u201d\nThe GOAL study used A1c to assess diabetes control in a real-world practice study aimed to assess predictive factors for achieving the glycemic\nhemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at six months as targeted by the treating physician in adults with type 2 diabetes. In this study, 2704 patients with a mean A1c\nof 9.7% were enrolled. After six months, lower baseline A1c (\u2265 8.5% vs <7%) was found to be a predictive factor for achieving glycemic control. The\nauthors also observed \u201cabsolute changes in the mean HbA1c of \u22121.7% and \u22122% were observed from baseline to six and twelve months, respectively.\u201d\nMitsios, et al. (2018) evaluated the association between A1c and stroke risk. Twenty-nine studies (n=532779) were included. The authors compared the\nnon-diabetic A1c range (<5.7%) to the diabetic range (\u22656.5%) and found that the diabetic range was associated with a 2.15-fold increased risk of first-\never stroke. The prediabetes range of 5.7%-6.5% was also not associated with first-ever stroke. The authors also observed that for every one percent\nincrease in A1c, the hazard ratio of first-ever stroke increased (1.12-fold for non-diabetic ranges, 1.17 for diabetic ones). This increased risk was also\nseen for ischemic stroke, with a hazard ratio of 1.49 for non-diabetic ranges and 1.24 for diabetic ranges.\nLudvigsson, et al. (2019) evaluated the association between preterm birth risk and periconceptional HbA1c levels in pregnant individuals with type 1\ndiabetes (T1D). Preterm birth was defined as <37 weeks and several secondary outcomes were also examined, which were \u201cneonatal death, large-for-\ngestational age, macrosomia, infant birth injury, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, five-minute Apgar score less than seven, and stillbirth.\u201d A total of\n2474 singletons born to individuals with T1D and 1165216 reference infants (children born to mothers without T1D) were included. The authors identified\n552 preterm births in the T1D cohort (22.3%) compared to 54287 in the control cohort (4.7%). Incidences of preterm birth were measured at several\nseparate thresholds, including <6.5%, 6.5%-7.8%, 7.8%-9.1%, and >9.1%. The T1D cohort\u2019s adjusted risk ratios (aRR) of preterm birth compared to the\ncontrol cohort were as\u00a0follows: 2.83 for <6.5%, 4.22 for 6.5%-7.8%, 5.56 for 7.8%-9.1%, and 6.91 for >9.1%. The corresponding aRRs for \u201cmedically\nindicated preterm birth\u201d (n=320) were 5.26, 7.42, 11.75 and 17.51, respectively. Increased HbA1c levels were also found to be associated with the\nsecondary clinical outcomes. The authors concluded that \u201cthe risk for preterm birth was strongly linked to periconceptional HbA1c levels.\nSaito, et al. (2019) examined the association of HbA1c variability (defined as visit-to-visit) and later onset of malignancies. The authors included 2640\npatients 50 years or older, with diabetes. A total of 330 patients (12.5%) developed malignancies during follow up. The authors stratified the patients\ninto quartiles of glycemic variability (defined as standard deviation of HbA1c) and found a \u201cdose-dependent association with tumorigenesis\u201d in the three\nhighest quartiles. The odds ratios were as follows: 1.20 for the second quartile, 1.43 for the third, and 2.19 for the highest. The authors concluded that\n\u201cthese results demonstrated that visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is a potential risk factor for later tumorigenesis. The association may be mediated by\noxidative stress or hormone variability.\u201d\nMa\u00f1\u00e9, et al. (2019) evaluated the \u201csuitability of first-trimester fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels in non-diabetic range to identify [individuals]\nwithout diabetes at increased pregnancy risk.\u201d Primary outcomes were defined as \u201cmacrosomia and pre-eclampsia\u201d and secondary outcomes were\ndefined as \u201cpreterm delivery, Caesarean section and large-for-gestational age.\u201d A total of 1228 pregnancies were included. Pregnant individuals with an\nHbA1c of \u22655.8% were found to have an increased risk of marcosomia (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69), an HbA1c of \u22655.9% was found to be associated with a\nthree-fold risk of pre-eclampsia, and an HbA1c of \u22656% was found to be associated with a four-fold risk of \u201clarge-for-gestational age.\u201d FPG levels were\nnot found to be associated with any pregnancy outcome.\nArbiol-Roca, et al. (2021) studied the clinical utility of HbA1c testing as a biomarker for detecting GDM and as a screening test to avoid the use of the\nOGTT. HbA1c levels were measured in 745 pregnant individuals and GDM was diagnosed in 38 patients based on HbA1c, age, and BMI. A cut off HbA1c\nvalue of 4.6% was determined to decide whether OGTT was needed or if it could be avoided. Using 4.6% HbA1c as the cut off value prevented two false\nnegatives, but only decreased the number of OGTTs performed by 7.2%. The authors conclude that \"adoption of HbA1c as a screening test for GDM may\neliminate the need of OGTT.\" Although the HbA1c test does not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as the sole diagnostic test, \"the use\nof a rule-out strategy in combination with the OGTT could be useful.\"\nHowever, the use of hemoglobin A1c testing is not useful in predicting all forms of dysglycemia. Tommerdahl, et al. (2019) evaluated several biomarkers\nfor their accuracy in screening for cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes. These biomarkers included \u201chemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 1,5-anhydroglucitol\n(1,5AG), fructosamine (FA), and glycated albumin (GA)\u201d and were compared to the current gold standard, OGTT 2-hour glucose. Fifty-eight patients with\nCF were included and \u201carea under the receiver operative characteristic (ROC-AUC) curves were generated.\u201d All ROC-AUCs for each biomarker were\n\u201clow\u201d both for cystic fibrosis-related prediabetes (CFPD, ROC-AUC 0.52-0.67) and CF-related diabetes (CFRD) (0.56-0.61). For CFRD, HbA1c was\nmeasured to have a 78% sensitivity and 41% specificity at a cutoff of 5.5%, which corresponds to a ROC-AUC of 0.61. The authors concluded that \u201cAll\nalternate markers tested demonstrate poor diagnostic accuracy for identifying CFRD by 2hG.\u201d\nIn a retrospective review of the UMass Memorial Health System electronic medical records from between 1997 and 2019, Darukhanavala, et al. (2021)\nevaluated the appropriateness of HbA1c as a screening tool for identifying patients with pre-CFRD dysglycemia to minimize the burden of annual two-\nhour OGTTs. The study included 56 patients categorized according to OGTT results (American Diabetes Association criteria): normal glucose tolerance\n(n=34), indeterminant glycemia (INDET, n=6), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, n=7), or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n=9). It was found that HbA1c\nwas positively correlated with blood glucose levels at the various time cut points (hour zero, hour one, and hour two), though the associations were\nquite weak (r = 0.248, r = 0.219, and r = 0.369, respectively). Furthermore, t-tests conducted suggested that the mean HbA1c was not significantly\ndifferent between patients with normal glucose tolerance and those in the INDET (p = 0.987), IFG (p = 0.690), and IGT (p = 0.874) groups, confirmed by\nANOVA (p = 0.250). Consequently, the authors reported that the \u201cresults do not support the use of HbA1c as a possible screening tool for pre-CFRD\ndysglycemic states, specifically INDET, IFG, and IGT.\u201d\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n5/15\nBy combining administrative datasets from the Veterans Health Administration and Medicare, Zhao, et al. (2021) evaluated the impact of hemoglobin\nA1c (A1c) variability\u2014the CV, described by A1c standard deviation divided by the average A1c value overall and expressed as a percent\u2014on the risk of\nhypoglycemia-related hospitalization (HRH) in veterans with diabetes mellitus. In this study sample of 342,059 patients, the authors identified a\n\u201cconsistent and positive relationship between A1c variability and HRH\u201d and noted that \u201cAverage A1c levels were also significantly and independently\nassociated with HRH, with levels <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) associated with lower risk and levels >9% (75 mmol/mol) conferring greater risk.\u201d Due to these\ndifferent levels of variability all remaining strong predictors of HRH risk up to three years following the baseline period, authors concluded that \u201ctracking\nA1c levels alone may be insufficient to mitigate risk.\u201d It was also acknowledged that a few limitations affected the generalizability of the study, such as\nthe lack of socioeconomic data, the study sample being predominantly white males, and including only veterans, the latter of which is a population\nwhere comorbidities are more prevalent. Consequently, these data may be reflective of \u201cthe complex interplay of disease severity, treatment, and\nsociodemographic factors,\u201d as is the case with other clinical findings.\nWhile poor outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) have been linked to diabetes, its relation to pre\u2010infection glycemic control is still unclear.\nBecause of this, Merzon, et al. (2021) investigated the association between pre\u2010infection HemoglobinA1c (A1C) levels and COVID\u201019 severity as\nassessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients (ages 14 to 103) with diabetes tested for COVID\u201019 in Leumit Health Services, Israel,\nbetween February 1 and April 30, 2020. Of the patients in this cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. A comparison of the mean HbA1c of\nthose who were COVID-19 positive (7.19%, 95% CI: 6.81%-7.57%) and the mean of those who were COVID-19 negative (6.59%, 95% CI: 6.52%-6.65%)\nwas found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). The authors expounded further by reporting the clinical characteristics of patients with diabetes\nhospitalized due to COVID-19 by demonstrating that the mean Hb1Ac levels between those hospitalized (n=46, 7.75%, 95% CI: 7.17%-8.32%) and those\nnot hospitalized (n=137, 6.83%, 95% CI: 6.54%-7.13%) were also statistically significant (p<0.005). Additionally, \u201cIn a multivariate logistic regression\nmodel adjusting for multiple potential risk factors and chronic conditions which may have a deleterious effect on disease outcomes (including age, sex,\nsmoking, IHD, SES, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, CVA, CHF, chronic lung disease, and obesity), only HbA1c \u2265 nine\npercent remained a significant predictor for hospitalization.\u201d Given the evidence, the researchers\u00a0urge \u201cPaying special attention to patients with\ndiabetes and an HbA1c \u2265 nine while allowing a more lenient approach to patients with well controlled disease,\u201d as this can reduce economic, social, and\npatient burden, especially for those who are at the greatest risk for reacting severely to COVID-19.\nXie, et al. (2021) investigated the role of FPG and glucose fluctuation on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients who already had prior diagnoses of\ndiabetes. Through a multivariate Cox analysis, the researchers found that FPG was \u201can independent prognostic factor of overall survival after\nadjustment for age, sex, diabetes, and severity of COVID-19 at admission (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25).\u201d However, blood glucose fluctuation was\nassociated with COVID-19 disease progression, as proven by the results found from the indices of the standard deviation of blood glucose and the\nlargest amplitude of glycemic excursions. Both FPG and blood glucose fluctuation indices were also found to be positively associated with increased\npresence of inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19, such as the \u201cwhite blood cell absolute count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, alkaline\nphosphatase, a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-hbdh), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase, [and] D-dimer.\u201d Ultimately, it was\nconcluded that diabetes was not an independent risk factor for in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients, as these findings were identified regardless of\ndiabetes status.\nYang, et al. (2019) aimed to find the appropriate threshold for FPG for defining prediabetes among children and adolescents. The sample was selected\nfrom school-aged children in Taiwan via a nationwide survey administered between 1992-2000, who then underwent physical examinations and blood\ntests if they exhibited abnormal urine test findings. The researchers found that the incidence of pediatric diabetes increased with increasing fasting\nplasma glucose levels, and those with FPG > 5.6mmol/L had higher adjusted hazard ratios. Additionally, \u201cthe association between fasting plasma\nglucose and incident pediatric diabetes and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were similar in boys and girls and were higher in\nthe age group twelve to eighteen years.\u201d In using 4.75 mmol/L as the optimal threshold for children six to eleven years, the sensitivity was 65% and\nspecificity was 51%. For the threshold of 5.19 mmol/L among children twelve to eighteen years, the sensitivity was 60% and the specificity was 73%.\nThis supports utilizing FPG as a supplement for diagnosing prediabetes among pediatric patients, which may contribute to better disease management.\nGeifman-Holtzman, et al. (2010) assessed the correlation between fetal macrosomia and abnormal OGTT in pregnant individuals with term gestation and\nnegative glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24 to 28 weeks. They recruited patients who had estimated fetal weights >90th percentile and a negative 50g\nGCT. From 170 individuals over a five-month period, they found that 10 patients or 5.9% had \u201cimpaired glucose metabolism at term.\u201d In this group, \u201cwe\nfound no correlation between GCT values at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks, family history of diabetes mellitus, the patient\u2019s [body mass index] or\nweight at term, and the diagnosis of impaired glucose metabolism.\u201d Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in mean fetal weight\nbetween those with normal versus abnormal OGTT. This demonstrated the lack of clinical utility of using OGTT at term for predicting the incidence of\nfetal macrosomia. The researchers suggested utilizing a larger scale study to solidify or contradict these conclusions.\nBi, et al. (2024) engaged in a cross-sectional study of participants aged >20 years old who underwent physical examination at the local hospital from\n2022 to 2023. A model was used to assess the dose-response relationship between liver enzymes and type 2 diabetes risk. Of the 14,100 participants,\nan analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between liver enzymes and\u00a0type 2 diabetes risk (P non-linear < 0.001). Specifically, type 2 diabetes risk\nincreased with rising ALT and GGT levels (range, <50 IU/L) and then leveled out when ALT and GGT levels were >50 IU/L. An elevated AST within a\ncertain range (range, <35 IU/L) decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes, but a mildly elevated AST (>35 IU/L) showed as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\nIn conclusion, liver enzymes were associated non-linearly with type 2 diabetes risk in different populations. Higher ALT and GGT levels were shown in\nthis study to increase type 2 diabetes risk as well. In conclusion, additional attention should be paid to elevated liver enzymes and diabetes, but more\nwork also needs to be done to assess association between elevation and T2D risk.\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA)\nThe ADA publishes an extensive guideline encompassing the standards of medical care in diabetes.

The recommendations concerning diabetes testing for children and adolescents are as follows:\n\u201cRisk-based screening for prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or \u226510 years of age, whichever\noccurs earlier, in youth with overweight (BMI \u226585th percentile) or obesity (BMI \u226595th percentile) and who have one or more additional risk factors\nfor diabetes.\u201d46 Grading based on risk factors;\nMaternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child's gestation-Grade A\nFamily history of type 2 diabetes in first- or second-degree relative-Grade A\nRace/ethnicity (Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American, Pacific Islander)-Grade A\nSigns of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary\nsyndrome, or small-for-gestational-age birth weight)-Grade B.\n\u201cIf tests are normal, repeat screening at a minimum of 3-year intervals [Grade E], or more frequently if BMI is increasing [Grade C].\u201d\n\u201cFasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and A1c can be used to test for prediabetes or [type 2]\ndiabetes in children and adolescents.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cChildren and adolescents with overweight or obesity in whom the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is being considered should have a panel of\npancreatic autoantibodies tested to exclude the possibility of autoimmune type 1 diabetes.\u201d Grade B\n8,46\n2\n2\n46\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n7/15\n\u201cAlthough A1c is not recommended for diagnosis of diabetes in children with cystic fibrosis or symptoms suggestive of acute onset of type 1\ndiabetes and only A1c assays without interference are appropriate for children with hemoglobinopathies, ADA continues to recommend A1c for\ndiagnosis of type 2 diabetes in this population (ungraded)\u201d\n\u201cA1C goals must be individualized and reassessed over time. An A1C of <7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate for many children\u201d Grade B.\nPregnancy (Ch 15)\n\u201c\u2026although A1c may be useful, it should be used as a secondary measure of glycemic control in pregnancy, after blood glucose monitoring.\u201d\n\u201cFasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring are recommended in individuals with diabetes in pregnancy to achieve optimal\nglucose levels. Glucose goals are fasting plasma glucose <95 mg/dL (<5.3 mmol/L) and either 1-h postprandial glucose <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L)\nor 2-h postprandial glucose <120 mg/dL (<6.7 mmol/L) Grade B\u201d\n\u201cDue to increased red blood cell turnover, A1C is slightly lower during pregnancy in people with and without diabetes. Ideally, the A1C goal in\npregnancy is <6% (<42 mmol/mol) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, but the goal may be relaxed to <7% (<53 mmol/mol) if\nnecessary to prevent hypoglycemia Grade B\u201d\n\u201cGiven the alteration in red blood cell kinetics during pregnancy and physiological changes in glycemic parameters, A1c levels may need \u201cto be\nmonitored more frequently than usual (e.g., monthly).\u201d\n\u201cThe OGTT is recommended over A1C at four to twelve weeks postpartum because A1C may be persistently impacted (lowered) by the increased\nred blood cell turnover related to pregnancy, by blood loss at delivery, or by the preceding three-month glucose profile. The OGTT is more\nsensitive at detecting glucose intolerance, including both prediabetes and diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cBecause GDM often represents previously undiagnosed prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, or even developing\ntype 1 diabetes, individuals with GDM should be tested for persistent diabetes or prediabetes at four to twelve weeks postpartum with a fasting\n75-g OGTT using nonpregnancy criteria as outlined in Section two, \u201cClassification and Diagnosis of Diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, a positive screen for diabetes requires two abnormal values. If both the fasting plasma glucose\n(\u2265126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L]) and 2-h plasma glucose (\u2265200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]) are abnormal in a single screening test, then the diagnosis of\ndiabetes is made. If only one abnormal value in the OGTT meets diabetes criteria, the test should be repeated to confirm that the abnormality\npersists.\u201d\n\u201cIndividuals with a history of GDM should have ongoing screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes every 1\u20133 years, even if the results of the\ninitial 4\u201312 week postpartum 75-g OGTT are normal. Ongoing evaluation may be performed with any recommended glycemic test (e.g., annual\nA1C, annual fasting plasma glucose, or triennial 75-g OGTT using thresholds for nonpregnant individuals).\u201d\nHeart Failure Considerations (ch. 10)\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals, routine screening for coronary artery disease is not recommended, as it does not improve outcomes as long as\nASCVD risk factors are treated.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cConsider investigations for coronary artery disease in the presence of any of the following: atypical cardiac symptoms; signs or symptoms of\nassociated vascular disease, including carotid bruits, transient ischemic attack, stroke, claudication, or PAD; or electrocardiogram abnormalities\n(e.g., Q waves).\u201d Grade E\n\u201cAdults with diabetes are at increased risk for the development of asymptomatic cardiac structural or functional abnormalities (stage B heart\nfailure) or symptomatic (stage C) heart failure. Consider screening adults with diabetes by measuring a natriuretic peptide (B-type natriuretic\npeptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-BNP [NTproBNP]) to facilitate prevention of stage C heart failure.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and abnormal natriuretic peptide levels, echocardiography is recommended to identify stage B heart\nfailure.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and age \u226550 years, microvascular disease in any location, or foot complications or any end-organ\ndamage from diabetes, screening for PAD with ankle-brachial index testing is recommended to guide treatment for cardiovascular disease\nprevention and limb preservation. A In individuals with diabetes duration \u226510 years, screening for PAD should be considered\u201d Grade B.\nNonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis & Chronic Kidney Disease (ch. 4 and ch. 11)\nFrom chapter 4:\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, particularly those with obesity or cardiometabolic risk factors or established cardiovascular disease,\nshould be screened/risk stratified for clinically significant liver fibrosis (defined as moderate fibrosis to cirrhosis) using a calculated fibrosis-4\nindex (FIB-4) (derived from age, ALT, AST, and platelets\u2026even if they have normal liver enzymes.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with diabetes or prediabetes with persistently elevated plasma aminotransferase levels for >6 months and low FIB-4 should be evaluated\nfor other causes of liver disease.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with an indeterminate or high FIB-4 should have additional risk stratification by liver stiffness\nmeasurement with transient elastography or the blood biomarker enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF).\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with indeterminate results or at high risk for significant liver fibrosis (i.e., by FIB-4, liver stiffness\nmeasurement, or ELF) should be referred to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for further workup. Interprofessional care is recommended for\nlong-term management Grade B.\u201d\nFrom chapter 11:\nAdditionally: \u201cA screening strategy based on elevated plasma aminotransferases >40 units/L would miss most individuals with NASH in these settings,\nas clinically significant fibrosis (\u2265F2) is frequently observed with plasma aminotransferases below the commonly used cutoff of 40 units/L. The American\nCollege of Gastroenterology considers the upper limit of normal ALT levels to be 29\u201333 units/L for male individuals and 19\u201325 units/L for female\nindividuals, as higher levels are associated with increased liver-related mortality, even in the absence of identifiable risk factors. The FIB-4 estimates\nthe risk of hepatic cirrhosis and is calculated from the computation of age, plasma aminotransferases (AST and ALT), and platelet count.\u201d\nIn regards to A1c and NASH, the ADA restricts its comments to the following: \u201cThe only proven primary prevention interventions for CKD in people with\ndiabetes are blood glucose (A1C goal of 7%) and blood pressure control (blood pressure <130/80 mmHg),\u201d and \u201cIntensive lowering of blood glucose with\nthe goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large, randomized studies to delay the onset and progression of albuminuria and reduce\neGFR in people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Insulin alone was used to lower blood glucose in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial\n(DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study of type 1 diabetes, while a variety of agents were used in clinical trials of type\n2 diabetes, supporting the conclusion that lowering blood glucose itself helps prevent CKD and its progression. The effects of glucose-lowering\ntherapies on CKD have helped define A1C goals.\u201d\nHospital Care Delivery Standards and Perioperative Care (ch. 16)\n49\n50\n51\n52,53\n54\n54\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n8/15\n\u201cPerform an A1C test on all people with diabetes or hyperglycemia (random blood glucose >140 mg/dL [>7.8 mmol/L]) admitted to the hospital if\nno A1C test result is available from the prior 3 months.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn hospitalized individuals with diabetes who are eating, point-of-care (POC) blood glucose monitoring should be performed before meals; in\nthose not eating, glucose monitoring is advised every 4\u20136 h. More frequent POC blood glucose monitoring ranging from every 30 min to every 2 h\nis the required standard for safe use of intravenous insulin therapy.\u201d (No grade; statement)\nThe following approach may be considered for those in preoperative and perioperative care:\n\u201cA preoperative risk assessment should be performed for people with diabetes who are at high risk for ischemic heart disease and those with\nautonomic neuropathy or renal failure.\nThe A1C goal for elective surgeries should be <8% (<63.9 mmol/L) whenever possible.\nThe blood glucose goal in the perioperative period should be 100\u2013180 mg/dL (5.6\u201310.0 mmol/L) within 4 h of the surgery. CGM should not be\nused alone for glucose monitoring during surgery.\nMetformin should be held on the day of surgery.\nSGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued 3\u20134 days before surgery.\nHold other oral glucose-lowering agents the morning of surgery or procedure and give one-half of NPH dose or 75\u201380% doses of long-acting\nanalog insulin or adjust insulin pump basal rates based on the type of diabetes and clinical judgment.\nMonitor blood glucose at least every 2\u20134 h while the individual takes nothing by mouth and dose with short- or rapid-acting insulin as needed.\nThere is little data on the safe use and/or influence of GLP-1 receptor agonists on glycemia and delayed gastric emptying in the perioperative\nperiod.\nStricter perioperative glycemic goals are not advised, as perioperative glycemic goals stricter than 80\u2013180 mg/dL (4.4\u201310.0 mmol/L) may not\nimprove outcomes and are associated with more hypoglycemia.\nCompared with usual dosing, a reduction by 25% of basal insulin given the evening before surgery is more likely to achieve perioperative blood\nglucose goals with a lower risk for hypoglycemia.\nIn individuals undergoing noncardiac general surgery, basal insulin plus premeal short- or rapid-acting insulin (basal-bolus) coverage has been\nassociated with improved glycemic outcomes and lower rates of perioperative complications compared with the reactive, correction-only short- or\nrapid-acting insulin coverage alone with no basal insulin dosing.\u201d\nThe ADA did not specifically mention \u201cbariatric surgery\u201d in their hospital care delivery section (ch. 16).\nDiabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee\nThis Expert Committee published a comprehensive guideline on the prevention and management of diabetes. Relevant items, recommendations, and\ncomments\u2014particularly those relating to the use of A1c testing\u2014are captured below:\n\u201cScreen for type 2 diabetes using a fasting plasma glucose and/or glycated hemoglobin (A1C) every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or\nin individuals at high risk on a risk calculator (33% chance of developing diabetes over ten years).\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of evidence for interventions to prevent or delay type 1 diabetes, routine screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended.\u201d\n\u201cFor most individuals with diabetes, A1C should be measured approximately every three months to ensure that glycemic goals are being met or\nmaintained. In some circumstances, such as when significant changes are made to therapy, or during pregnancy, it is appropriate to check A1C\nmore frequently. Testing at least every six months should be performed in adults during periods of treatment and healthy behavior stability when\nglycemic targets have been consistently achieved.\u201d\nA1C can be misleading in various medical conditions (\u201ce.g., hemoglobinopathies, iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia, severe hepatic or renal\ndisease\u201d) and should not be used for \u201cdiagnostic use in children and adolescents (as the sole diagnostic test), pregnant [individuals] as part of\nroutine screening for gestational diabetes, those with cystic fibrosis or those with suspected type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nDiabetes \u201cshould\u201d be diagnosed at a level of A1C \u22656.5%.\n\u201cScreening for diabetes using FPG and/or A1C should be performed every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or at high risk using a risk\ncalculator [Grade D, Consensus]. Earlier testing and/or more frequent follow up (every six to twelve months) with either FPG and/or A1C should\nbe considered in those at very high risk using a risk calculator or in people with additional risk factors for diabetes [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d\nIt should be mentioned that \u201cGlycemic targets should be individualized [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d based upon various considerations including, but not\nlimited to, the patient\u2019s functional dependence, medical history, life expectancy, and life course stage. Moreover, the grading of recommendations above\n(e.g., \u201cGrade D\u201d) reflect the methodological rigor used at arriving at the conclusion, such that lower grades reflect the presence of weaker evidence. But\nthough the \u201cpaucity of clinical evidence addressing the areas of therapy, prevention, diagnosis or prognosis precluded the assignment of a higher\ngrade,\u201d the authors recognize and note that many Grade D recommendations are \u201cvery important to the contemporary management of diabetes.\u201d\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)\nThe USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who are overweight or obese, and such\n\u201cScreening tests for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes include measurement of fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c level or an oral glucose tolerance test.\u201d\nRecognizing that \u201cThe optimal screening interval for adults with an initial normal glucose test result is uncertain,\u201d the USPSTF suggests that \u201cScreening\nevery three years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels.\u201d\nThe USPSTF has also provided guidelines pertaining to the screening of gestational diabetes. For asymptomatic pregnant persons at 24 weeks\ngestation or after, with a letter \u201cB\u201d grade, the USPSTF recommends screening for gestational diabetes in this population. However, in asymptomatic\npregnant persons before 24 weeks gestation, the USPSTF states that \u201ccurrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of\nscreening\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nAn \u201cI\u201d grade is defined by the USPSTF as \u201cI Statement- The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits\nand harms cannot be determined.\u201d\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n9/15\nIn 2022, the USPSTF released its first recommendation on screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. This recommendation applies to\nchildren and adolescents who are not pregnant and who are younger than 18 years of age without known diabetes or prediabetes and who are without\nsymptoms of diabetes or prediabetes. The USPSTF states that the goal of screening for type 2 diabetes in young people is \u201cto diagnose and treat it\nearly to prevent development of bad health outcomes. However, no studies have looked at the link between screening for type 2 diabetes in children and\nadolescents and bad health outcomes. Studies about the effect of type 2 diabetes treatment on health outcomes in children and adolescents have not\nhad enough patients with bad outcomes to draw any meaningful conclusions. No studies have looked at harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in young\npeople. Potential harms may include side effects from medications used to treat diabetes, such as low blood glucose, nausea, or vomiting.\u201d Based on\nthe current evidence for asymptomatic children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age, the USPSTF concluded that \u201ccurrent evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)\nThe Global Report on Diabetes states that: \u201cGlycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the method of choice for monitoring glycaemic control in diabetes. An\nadvantage of using HbA1c is that the patient does not need to be in a fasting state. Ideally it should be measured twice a year in people\u00a0with type 2\ndiabetes and more frequently in those with type 1 diabetes. However, HbA1c testing is more costly than glucose measurement, and therefore less\nreadily available. If HbA1c testing is not available, fasting, or post-meal blood glucose is an acceptable substitute.\u201d\nThe WHO also published a \u201cmodule\u201d titled \u201cHearts-D: Diagnosis and Management of Type 2 Diabetes in 2020. In it, a testing algorithm for \u201ctreatment of\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin\u201d is included at the bottom. The algorithm calls for an HbA1c assessment to be performed \u201cin three months\u201d if the\npatient is stabilized as a result of the insulin treatment.\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)\nIn 2022, the AAFP published a clinical summary of the USPSTF recommendation for screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The\ndocument deferred to the USPSTF recommendations, with the testing audience being \u201cNonpregnant adults aged thirty-five to seventy years who have\noverweight or obesity and no symptoms of diabetes\u201d\u2014a move from 40 years of age in the previous recommendation\u2014while deeming screening every\nthree years to be a reasonable approach.\nEndocrine Society\nThe Endocrine Society published this guideline regarding management of diabetes in older adults. In it, they recommend screening for prediabetes or\ndiabetes every two years for patients 65 years or older. FPG and/or HbA1c may be used. However, the Society does recommend caution when\ninterpreting HbA1c results, as older patients are more likely to have conditions that alter red blood cell turnover.\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\nNICE published an update to their guideline on diabetes management. In it, they make the following recommendations:\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c levels in adults with type 2 diabetes every:\nThree to six months (tailored to individual needs) until HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy.\nSix months once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable.\u201d\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c using methods calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardization.\u201d\n\u201cIf HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type, estimate trends in blood glucose control using\none of the following:\nquality-controlled plasma glucose profiles\ntotal glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)\nfructosamine estimation.\u201d\n\u201cInvestigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes\nor clinical biochemistry.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)\nThe AACE provides the following inclusion criteria for individuals who should be screened for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes:\nAge \u226545 years without other risk factors\nCVD or family history of T2D\nOverweight or obese\nSedentary lifestyle\nMember of an at-risk racial or ethnic group:\nAsian\nAfrican American\nHispanic\nNative American (Alaska Natives and American Indians)\nPacific Islander\nHigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level >250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L)\nImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and/or metabolic syndrome\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), acanthosis nigricans, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\nHypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg or on antihypertensive therapy)\nHistory of gestational diabetes or delivery of a baby weighing more than 5 kg (9 lb)\nAntipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia and/or severe bipolar disease\nChronic glucocorticoid exposure\nSleep disorders in the presence of glucose intolerance (A1C >5.7%, IGT, or IFG on previous testing), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),\nchronic sleep deprivation, and night-shift occupation\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n10/15\nThe AACE recommends repeat testing at least every three years for individuals with normal results. Consider annual screening for patients with two or\nmore risk factors.\nIn a 2022 update focusing on developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan, the AACE expounds on how the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus\nshould be made. According to the authors, the ELs refer to evidence levels established by AACE evidence ratings, where \u201cdescriptors of \u201cmust,\u201d\n\u201cshould,\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d generally but not strictly correlate with Grade A (strong), Grade B (intermediate), and Grade C (weak) recommendations,\nrespectively.\u201d\nThe relevant recommendations are captured below.\n\u201cRecommendation 1.1\nThe diagnosis of DM is based on the following criteria\u2026:\nFPG concentration \u2265126 mg/dL (after \u2265 eight hours of an overnight fast), or\nPlasma glucose (PG) concentration \u2265200 mg/dL two hours after ingesting a 75-g oral glucose load after an overnight fast of at least eight hours,\nor\nSymptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia) and a random (nonfasting) PG concentration \u2265200 mg/dL, or\nA1C level \u22656.5%\nDiagnosis of DM requires two abnormal test results, either from the same sample or two abnormal results on samples drawn on different days. However,\na glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms for DM confirms the diagnosis of DM.\nGrade A; BEL 2 and expert opinion of task force\nRecommendation 1.2\nPrediabetes is identified by the presence of IFG (100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), which is a PG value of 140 to 199 mg/dL two\nhours after ingesting 75 g of glucose, and/or A1C value between 5.7% and 6.4% (Table 4). A1C should be used only for screening for prediabetes. The\ndiagnosis of prediabetes, which may manifest as either IFG or IGT, should be confirmed with glucose testing.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.3\nT1D is characterized by marked insulin deficiency in the presence of hyperglycemia and positive autoantibody tests to glutamic acid decarboxylase\n(GAD65), pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells (tyrosine phosphatase IA-2), and IA-2b zinc transporter (ZnT8), and/or insulin. The presence of immune markers and\nclinical presentation are needed to establish the correct diagnosis and to distinguish between T1D and T2D in children or adults, as well as to determine\nappropriate treatment.\nGrade A; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.4\nT2D is characterized by progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion and variable defects in insulin sensitivity. T2D is often asymptomatic and can remain\nundiagnosed for many years; therefore, all adults \u226535 years of age with risk factors should be screened for DM (Table 5).\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.5\nGDM is defined as carbohydrate intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy and resolves postpartum. Pregnant individuals with risk\nfactors for DM should be screened at the first prenatal visit for undiagnosed T2D using standard criteria (Table 4).\nGrade B; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.6\nScreen all pregnant individuals for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Diagnose GDM with either the one-step or the two-step\napproach.\nThe one-step approach uses a two-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after \u2265 eight hours of fasting with diagnostic cutoffs of one or\nmore FPG \u226592 mg/dL, one-hour PG \u2265180 mg/dL, or two-hour PG \u2265153 mg/dL.\nThe two-step approach uses a nonfasting one-hour 50-g glucose challenge test with one-hour PG screening threshold of 130 or 140 mg/dL. For\nindividuals with a positive screening test, the three-hour 100-g OGTT is used for diagnosis with two or more PG tests that meet the following\nthresholds: FPG \u226595 mg/dL, 1-hour \u2265180 mg/dL, 2-hour \u2265155 mg/dL, 3-hour \u2265140 mg/dL.\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.7\nClinicians should consider evaluation for monogenic DM in any child or young adult with an atypical presentation, clinical course, or response to\ntherapy. Monogenic DM includes neonatal diabetes and nonautoimmune diabetes of multiple genetic causes, also known as maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young (MODY). Most children with DM occurring under six months of age have a monogenic cause as autoimmune T1D rarely occurs before six\nmonths of age. Other monogenic forms of diabetes are characterized by mutation of genes of transcription factors, genes regulating pancreatic\ndevelopment or atrophy, abnormal insulin genes, genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress that impair insulin secretion, or abnormal glucokinase\ngenes that cause impaired insulin signaling.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nAlthough not expressly listed as recommendations for diabetes screening, some additional information of note includes the following:\n\u201cA glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of hyperglycemia symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia confirm the diagnosis of DM. In\nindividuals with discordant results from two different tests, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated on a different\nday.\u201d\n\u201cIn view of physiological changes in pregnancy that could affect glycated hemoglobin levels, A1C should not be used for GDM screening or\ndiagnosis of DM.\u201d\n66\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n11/15\n\u201cAll pregnant individuals should be screened for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Universal screening is recommended, as\nselective screening (only in individuals with risk factors) would miss a significant number of individuals with GDM and universal screening has\nbeen shown to be cost-effective compared with selective screening.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE)\nThe 2020 Consensus Statement from the AACE/ACE on the Management of Type 2 Diabetes states:\n\"The hemoglobin A1c (A1c) target should be individualized based on numerous factors such as age, life expectancy, comorbid conditions,\nduration of diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia or adverse consequences from hypoglycemia, patient motivation, and adherence.\"\n\u201cAn A1c level of \u22646.5% is considered optimal if it can be achieved in a safe and affordable manner, but higher targets may be appropriate for\ncertain individuals and may change for a given individual over time.\u201d\n\u201cTherapy must be evaluated frequently (e.g., every three months) until stable using multiple criteria, including A1c, SMBG records (fasting and\npostprandial) or continuous glucose monitoring tracings, documented and suspected hypoglycemia events, lipid and BP values, adverse events\n(weight gain, fluid retention, hepatic or renal impairment, or CVD), comorbidities, other relevant laboratory data, concomitant drug administration,\ncomplications of diabetes, and psychosocial factors affecting patient care. Less frequent monitoring is acceptable once targets are achieved.\u201d\nIn 2023, the AACE/ACE released \u201cGuidelines and Recommendations for Laboratory Analysis in the Diagnosis and Management of Diabetes Mellitus.\u201d\nDiagnosis related recommendations:\n\u201cFasting glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used to establish the diagnosis of diabetes, with a value \u22657.0 mmol/L (\u2265126 mg/dL)\ndiagnostic of diabetes. A (high)\u201d\nScreening related recommendations:\n\u201cRecommendation: Screening by HbA1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT is recommended for individuals who are at high risk of diabetes. If HbA1c is <5.7%\n(<39 mmol/mol), FPG is <5.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL), and/or 2-h plasma glucose is <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year\nintervals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used for screening of high-risk individuals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Plasma glucose should be measured in an accredited laboratory when used for diagnosis of or screening for diabetes. GPP\n(good practice point)\u201d\nMonitoring/Prognosis:\n\u201cRecommendation: Routine measurement of plasma glucose concentrations in a laboratory is not recommended as the primary means of\nmonitoring or evaluating therapy in individuals with diabetes. B (moderate)\u201d\nKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Diabetes Working Group\nThe KDIGO group published recommendations on diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). They recommend using HbA1c to monitor diabetic and\nCKD patients twice a year or as often as four times a year if glycemic target is not met or a change is made in therapy. KDIGO advises that \"accuracy\nand precision of HbA1c measurement declines with advanced CKD, particularly among patients treated by dialysis, in whom HbA1c measurements have\nlow reliability.\" They also recommend an \"individualized HbA1c target ranging from <6.5% to <8.0% in patients with diabetes and CKD not treated with\ndialysis.\u201d\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a condition where there is a buildup of fat in the liver. It is seen in individuals who\ndrink little to no alcohol but who have\u00a0diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. Diabetes is both a possible cause of and or symptom\nof MASLD: while diabetes is a risk factor for developing MASLD, individuals who have been diagnosed with MASLD may be at risk for developing heart\ndisease and diabetes.",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\nPrevalence: In 2021, 38.4 million Americans, or 11.6% of the population, had diabetes. Approximately 1.9 million American children and adults\nhave type 1 diabetes, including about 244,000 children and adolescents.\nDiagnosed and undiagnosed: Of the 38.4 million, 29.7 million were diagnosed, and 8.7 million were undiagnosed.\nPrevalence in seniors: The percentage of Americans aged 65 and older remains high, at 29.2%, or 15.9 million seniors (diagnosed and\nundiagnosed).\nNew cases: 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year.\nPrediabetes: In 2021, 97.6 million Americans aged eighteen and older had prediabetes.\nDeaths: Diabetes remains the 8th leading cause of death in the United States in 2021, with 103,294 death certificates listing it as the underlying\ncause of death, and a total of 399.401 death certificates listing diabetes as a cause of death.\nTotal economic cost of diabetes care in the United States: $413 billion in 2022.\nDiabetes can be classified into the following categories:\n\u201cType 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune \u03b2-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency)\u201d\n\u201cType 2 diabetes (due to a progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background of insulin resistance)\u201d\n\u201cGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior\nto gestation)\u201d\n\u201cSpecific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young [MODY]), diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as\nwith glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, or after organ transplantation)\u201d  The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is easily established\nwhen a patient presents with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, which include polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, blurred vision, and, infrequently,\nweight loss. The frequency of symptomatic diabetes has been decreasing in parallel with improved efforts to diagnose diabetes earlier through\nscreening. Increasingly, the majority of patients are asymptomatic, and hyperglycemia is noted on routine laboratory evaluation, prompting further\ntesting.\n6,7\n8\n3\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n3/15\nGlycated hemoglobin A1c (also known as HbA1c, A1c, glycohemoglobin, or hemoglobin A1c) testing plays a key role in the management of diabetes.\nNew hemoglobin enters circulation with minimal glucose attached. However, glucose irreversibly binds to hemoglobin based on the surrounding blood\nglucose concentration. Therefore, A1c is considered a measure of blood glucose level, albeit an indirect one. It is best correlated with the mean glucose\nlevel over the last eight to twelve weeks as red blood cells experience significant turnover. Various factors may affect the reliability of A1c (atypical\nhemoglobins or hemoglobinopathies, chronic kidney disease, et al.), but most assays have been standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications\nTrial (DCCT) standard, which \u201cestimated the mean blood glucose concentrations derived from seven measurements a day (before and ninety minutes\nafter each of the three major\u00a0meals, and before bedtime), performed once every three months and compared the average glucose concentration with\nA1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nThe HbA1c assay provides information about the degree of long-term glucose control,  and has been recommended for the diagnosis and monitoring of\ndiabetes.\nVarious methods of HbA1c measurement include chromatography based HPLC assay, boronate affinity, antibody-based immunoassay, and\nenzyme based enzymatic assay.\nLong-term blood sugar control has been associated with decreased risk of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and\ncardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial, cerebrovascular disease,\nand myocardial fibrosis in adults with diabetes.\nHigher HbA1c variability has\nbeen associated with higher all-cause mortality in patients with Type 2 Diabetes.\nFasting plasma glucose is a method of glucose monitoring that measures an individual\u2019s glucose level typically in a period defined with no caloric intake\nfor eight hours or more. Its usage in the diagnosis of diabetes lies primarily in gestational diabetes, along with the OGTT, but HbA1c, FPG, or OGTTs\nwith their respective positive results can be used in diagnosing diabetes mellitus in nonpregnant individuals as well. To diagnose diabetes in\nasymptomatic individuals, a FPG has to be \u2265 126 mg/dL. For diagnosing prediabetes, an individual may have \u201cimpaired fasting glucose,\u201d which would\npresent with a range of 100-125 mg/Dl.\nTraditionally, the diagnosis of diabetes was predicated on plasma glucose levels as well as symptom presentation. In 2010, the ADA endorsed as a\n\u201creliable retrospective marker of blood glucose control over the past 6-8 weeks.\u201d The advantages of HbA1c testing include increased convenience,\nincreased stability and decreased variation in measurement. While the ADA 2023 guidelines gave precedence to FPG, the latest 2024 guideline\naddressed the vital importance of HbA1c for both diagnostic and screening purposes (for both diabetes and prediabetes care).\nThe ADA notes that there are areas where HbA1c is insufficient and plasma glucose levels are the preferred measurement: \u201cIn the presence of\nhemoglobin variants, pregnancy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and other conditions that might potentially interfere with accurate\nHbA1c measurements, plasma glucose levels are preferred. Furthermore, in situations where elevated blood glucose levels might not be consistently\napparent, the diagnosis of diabetes necessitates two abnormal test results (HbA1c and plasma glucose) either simultaneously or at different time points.\nIn such scenarios, alternative biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin emerge as viable options for monitoring glycemic status.\nFructosamine reflects the total pool of glycated serum proteins, mainly albumin, reflecting glycemic trends over a span of two to four weeks\u2014a relatively\nshorter duration compared to A1C. Although these biomarkers show a strong correlation and are associated with long-term complications based on\nepidemiological evidence, the empirical support for their application is not as robust as that for HbA1c.\u201d\nThe OGTT can be more inconvenient and used in the setting to diagnose GDM. Normally, 75g of glucose is ingested by the patient, and if the patient\nhas a two-hour plasma glucose value of \u2265200 mg/dL, a diagnosis of diabetes can be made. The test can also be performed at one-hour with 50g oral\nglucose, with positive GDM diagnostic results between 130-140 mg/dL as part of a two-step approach with the three-hour 100g test, which can be\ndiagnostic of GDM with two elevated values. For prediabetes with an accompanied \u201cimpaired glucose tolerance,\u201d a two-hour plasma glucose value\nbetween 140-199 mg/dL is used. However, the WHO requires an additional FPG <126 in addition to the two-hour plasma glucose value to establish\nimpaired glucose tolerance.\nAnalytical Validity\nThe International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Working Group on HbA1c Standardization has developed a reference\nmeasurement system and the measurement of HbA1c is currently well-standardized,\nand a sound reference system is in place to ensure continuity and\nstability of the analytical validity of HbA1c measurement.\nIn contrast, plasma glucose concentration remains difficult to assay with consistent\naccuracy.\nHbA1c has greater analytical stability (consistency with repetitive sample testing) and less day-to-day variability than either the fasting\nplasma glucose (FPG)or two-hour PG.\nFor any given individual, the HbA1c exhibits little short-term biologic variability; its coefficient of variation\n(CV) is 3.6%, compared to FPG (CV of 5.7%) and 2-h PG (CV of 16.6%).\nA sample proficiency testing survey performed by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and College of American Pathologists\n(CAP) evaluated the accuracy of A1c assays. The survey found that \u201cmethod-specific, between-laboratory CV\u2019s ranged from 0.7% to 4.0%\u201d and\n\u201capproximately 85% of laboratories are using methods with CVs <3% at all five HbA1c levels.\u201d The survey also noted the current pass limit was \u00b16%, but\nusing a pass rate of 97.1% to 98.0% of labs passed.\nClinical Utility and Validity\nTesting A1c, FPG, and 2-h PG measure different aspects of glycemia and are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1c \u22656.5% identifies fewer\nindividuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria; however, a recent study concluded that twelve percent of patients can be misclassified with\nrespect to diabetes diagnosis due to laboratory instrument error in measuring glucose.\nThe New Hoorn Study analyzed the diagnostic properties of the\nA1c, using OGTT as the diagnostic criterion.\nThe analysis suggested that an A1c of 5.8% had a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 91%. This\ncompares with specificity of 24% and sensitivity of 99% for the A1c cut point of 6.5%. On the other hand, the 6.5% cut point had a positive predictive\nvalue of 93%, compared with a positive predictive value of only 24% for a cut point of 5.8%.\nWhen using the reference diagnosis of diabetes being a two-hour blood glucose >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT, the specificity of FPG \u2265126\nmg/dL was >95% and sensitivity about 50%, with possibly lower sensitivities and specificities for individuals over 65 years.27 With the same OGTT\nreference, the specificity and sensitivity of an A1c \u22656.5%, as per diagnosis of diabetes, were reported as 79% and 44%, respectively.\nCowie, et al. (2010) \u201cexamined prevalence\u2019s of previously diagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes and high risk for diabetes using recently\nsuggested A1c criteria in the U.S. during 2003\u20132006. We compared these prevalence\u2019s to those in earlier surveys and those using glucose criteria.\u201d\n14,611 individuals were included (completed a household interview) and classified for diagnosed diabetes and by A1c, fasting, and 2-h glucose\nchallenge values. Diagnostic values for A1c were \u22656.5% for \u201cundiagnosed\u201d diabetes and 6%-6.5% for \u201chigh risk\u201d of diabetes. The authors found that by\nthese A1c diagnostic values, the \u201ccrude prevalence\u201d of diabetes in adults older than twenty years was 20.4 million, of which nineteen percent went\nundiagnosed based on A1c \u2265 6.5%. The authors then stated that the A1c criteria only diagnosed thirty percent of the undiagnosed diabetic group.\n5\n9\n8,10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n3,4\n15\n4,16\n17\n18\n19\n20,21\n22,23\n24\n25\n26\n22\n28\n29\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n4/15\nMamtora, et al. (2021) assessed the clinical utility of point-of-care (POC) HbA1c testing in the ophthalmology outpatient setting. Forty-nine patients with\ndiabetic retinopathy underwent POC HbA1c testing and blood pressure measurement. Of the 49 patients, 81.6% had POC readings above the\nrecommended HbA1c levels and only 16.3% of these patients were aware of their elevated HbA1c levels. Fourteen patients (33.3%) with high HbA1c\nreadings were referred to secondary diabetic services and 88.8% of patients felt like the test was useful. The authors suggest that POC HbA1c testing is\na \"cost-effective, reproducible and clinically significant tool for the management of diabetes in an outpatient ophthalmology setting, allowing the rapid\nrecognition of high-risk patients and appropriate referral to secondary diabetic services.\"\nGoodney, et al. (2016) evaluated the consistency of A1c testing of diabetes patients and its effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The study included\n1574415 Medicare patients with diabetes mellitus, and the consistency of testing was separated into three categories: \u201clow (testing in zero or one of\nthree years), medium (testing in two of three years), and high (testing in all three years).\u201d Approximately 70.2% of patients received high-consistency\ntesting, 17.6% received medium-consistency, and 12.2% received low-consistency. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) included \u201cdeath,\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, amputation, or the need for leg revascularization.\u201d Low-consistency patients was associated with death or other adverse\nevents (hazard ratio: 1.21). The authors concluded that \u201cconsistent annual hemoglobin A1c testing is associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular\noutcomes in this observational cohort of Medicare patients of diabetes mellitus.\u201d\nThe GOAL study used A1c to assess diabetes control in a real-world practice study aimed to assess predictive factors for achieving the glycemic\nhemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at six months as targeted by the treating physician in adults with type 2 diabetes. In this study, 2704 patients with a mean A1c\nof 9.7% were enrolled. After six months, lower baseline A1c (\u2265 8.5% vs <7%) was found to be a predictive factor for achieving glycemic control. The\nauthors also observed \u201cabsolute changes in the mean HbA1c of \u22121.7% and \u22122% were observed from baseline to six and twelve months, respectively.\u201d\nMitsios, et al. (2018) evaluated the association between A1c and stroke risk. Twenty-nine studies (n=532779) were included. The authors compared the\nnon-diabetic A1c range (<5.7%) to the diabetic range (\u22656.5%) and found that the diabetic range was associated with a 2.15-fold increased risk of first-\never stroke. The prediabetes range of 5.7%-6.5% was also not associated with first-ever stroke. The authors also observed that for every one percent\nincrease in A1c, the hazard ratio of first-ever stroke increased (1.12-fold for non-diabetic ranges, 1.17 for diabetic ones). This increased risk was also\nseen for ischemic stroke, with a hazard ratio of 1.49 for non-diabetic ranges and 1.24 for diabetic ranges.\nLudvigsson, et al. (2019) evaluated the association between preterm birth risk and periconceptional HbA1c levels in pregnant individuals with type 1\ndiabetes (T1D). Preterm birth was defined as <37 weeks and several secondary outcomes were also examined, which were \u201cneonatal death, large-for-\ngestational age, macrosomia, infant birth injury, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, five-minute Apgar score less than seven, and stillbirth.\u201d A total of\n2474 singletons born to individuals with T1D and 1165216 reference infants (children born to mothers without T1D) were included. The authors identified\n552 preterm births in the T1D cohort (22.3%) compared to 54287 in the control cohort (4.7%). Incidences of preterm birth were measured at several\nseparate thresholds, including <6.5%, 6.5%-7.8%, 7.8%-9.1%, and >9.1%. The T1D cohort\u2019s adjusted risk ratios (aRR) of preterm birth compared to the\ncontrol cohort were as\u00a0follows: 2.83 for <6.5%, 4.22 for 6.5%-7.8%, 5.56 for 7.8%-9.1%, and 6.91 for >9.1%. The corresponding aRRs for \u201cmedically\nindicated preterm birth\u201d (n=320) were 5.26, 7.42, 11.75 and 17.51, respectively. Increased HbA1c levels were also found to be associated with the\nsecondary clinical outcomes. The authors concluded that \u201cthe risk for preterm birth was strongly linked to periconceptional HbA1c levels.\nSaito, et al. (2019) examined the association of HbA1c variability (defined as visit-to-visit) and later onset of malignancies. The authors included 2640\npatients 50 years or older, with diabetes. A total of 330 patients (12.5%) developed malignancies during follow up. The authors stratified the patients\ninto quartiles of glycemic variability (defined as standard deviation of HbA1c) and found a \u201cdose-dependent association with tumorigenesis\u201d in the three\nhighest quartiles. The odds ratios were as follows: 1.20 for the second quartile, 1.43 for the third, and 2.19 for the highest. The authors concluded that\n\u201cthese results demonstrated that visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is a potential risk factor for later tumorigenesis. The association may be mediated by\noxidative stress or hormone variability.\u201d\nMa\u00f1\u00e9, et al. (2019) evaluated the \u201csuitability of first-trimester fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels in non-diabetic range to identify [individuals]\nwithout diabetes at increased pregnancy risk.\u201d Primary outcomes were defined as \u201cmacrosomia and pre-eclampsia\u201d and secondary outcomes were\ndefined as \u201cpreterm delivery, Caesarean section and large-for-gestational age.\u201d A total of 1228 pregnancies were included. Pregnant individuals with an\nHbA1c of \u22655.8% were found to have an increased risk of marcosomia (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69), an HbA1c of \u22655.9% was found to be associated with a\nthree-fold risk of pre-eclampsia, and an HbA1c of \u22656% was found to be associated with a four-fold risk of \u201clarge-for-gestational age.\u201d FPG levels were\nnot found to be associated with any pregnancy outcome.\nArbiol-Roca, et al. (2021) studied the clinical utility of HbA1c testing as a biomarker for detecting GDM and as a screening test to avoid the use of the\nOGTT. HbA1c levels were measured in 745 pregnant individuals and GDM was diagnosed in 38 patients based on HbA1c, age, and BMI. A cut off HbA1c\nvalue of 4.6% was determined to decide whether OGTT was needed or if it could be avoided. Using 4.6% HbA1c as the cut off value prevented two false\nnegatives, but only decreased the number of OGTTs performed by 7.2%. The authors conclude that \"adoption of HbA1c as a screening test for GDM may\neliminate the need of OGTT.\" Although the HbA1c test does not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as the sole diagnostic test, \"the use\nof a rule-out strategy in combination with the OGTT could be useful.\"\nHowever, the use of hemoglobin A1c testing is not useful in predicting all forms of dysglycemia. Tommerdahl, et al. (2019) evaluated several biomarkers\nfor their accuracy in screening for cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes. These biomarkers included \u201chemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 1,5-anhydroglucitol\n(1,5AG), fructosamine (FA), and glycated albumin (GA)\u201d and were compared to the current gold standard, OGTT 2-hour glucose. Fifty-eight patients with\nCF were included and \u201carea under the receiver operative characteristic (ROC-AUC) curves were generated.\u201d All ROC-AUCs for each biomarker were\n\u201clow\u201d both for cystic fibrosis-related prediabetes (CFPD, ROC-AUC 0.52-0.67) and CF-related diabetes (CFRD) (0.56-0.61). For CFRD, HbA1c was\nmeasured to have a 78% sensitivity and 41% specificity at a cutoff of 5.5%, which corresponds to a ROC-AUC of 0.61. The authors concluded that \u201cAll\nalternate markers tested demonstrate poor diagnostic accuracy for identifying CFRD by 2hG.\u201d\nIn a retrospective review of the UMass Memorial Health System electronic medical records from between 1997 and 2019, Darukhanavala, et al. (2021)\nevaluated the appropriateness of HbA1c as a screening tool for identifying patients with pre-CFRD dysglycemia to minimize the burden of annual two-\nhour OGTTs. The study included 56 patients categorized according to OGTT results (American Diabetes Association criteria): normal glucose tolerance\n(n=34), indeterminant glycemia (INDET, n=6), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, n=7), or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n=9). It was found that HbA1c\nwas positively correlated with blood glucose levels at the various time cut points (hour zero, hour one, and hour two), though the associations were\nquite weak (r = 0.248, r = 0.219, and r = 0.369, respectively). Furthermore, t-tests conducted suggested that the mean HbA1c was not significantly\ndifferent between patients with normal glucose tolerance and those in the INDET (p = 0.987), IFG (p = 0.690), and IGT (p = 0.874) groups, confirmed by\nANOVA (p = 0.250). Consequently, the authors reported that the \u201cresults do not support the use of HbA1c as a possible screening tool for pre-CFRD\ndysglycemic states, specifically INDET, IFG, and IGT.\u201d\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n5/15\nBy combining administrative datasets from the Veterans Health Administration and Medicare, Zhao, et al. (2021) evaluated the impact of hemoglobin\nA1c (A1c) variability\u2014the CV, described by A1c standard deviation divided by the average A1c value overall and expressed as a percent\u2014on the risk of\nhypoglycemia-related hospitalization (HRH) in veterans with diabetes mellitus. In this study sample of 342,059 patients, the authors identified a\n\u201cconsistent and positive relationship between A1c variability and HRH\u201d and noted that \u201cAverage A1c levels were also significantly and independently\nassociated with HRH, with levels <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) associated with lower risk and levels >9% (75 mmol/mol) conferring greater risk.\u201d Due to these\ndifferent levels of variability all remaining strong predictors of HRH risk up to three years following the baseline period, authors concluded that \u201ctracking\nA1c levels alone may be insufficient to mitigate risk.\u201d It was also acknowledged that a few limitations affected the generalizability of the study, such as\nthe lack of socioeconomic data, the study sample being predominantly white males, and including only veterans, the latter of which is a population\nwhere comorbidities are more prevalent. Consequently, these data may be reflective of \u201cthe complex interplay of disease severity, treatment, and\nsociodemographic factors,\u201d as is the case with other clinical findings.\nWhile poor outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) have been linked to diabetes, its relation to pre\u2010infection glycemic control is still unclear.\nBecause of this, Merzon, et al. (2021) investigated the association between pre\u2010infection HemoglobinA1c (A1C) levels and COVID\u201019 severity as\nassessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients (ages 14 to 103) with diabetes tested for COVID\u201019 in Leumit Health Services, Israel,\nbetween February 1 and April 30, 2020. Of the patients in this cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. A comparison of the mean HbA1c of\nthose who were COVID-19 positive (7.19%, 95% CI: 6.81%-7.57%) and the mean of those who were COVID-19 negative (6.59%, 95% CI: 6.52%-6.65%)\nwas found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). The authors expounded further by reporting the clinical characteristics of patients with diabetes\nhospitalized due to COVID-19 by demonstrating that the mean Hb1Ac levels between those hospitalized (n=46, 7.75%, 95% CI: 7.17%-8.32%) and those\nnot hospitalized (n=137, 6.83%, 95% CI: 6.54%-7.13%) were also statistically significant (p<0.005). Additionally, \u201cIn a multivariate logistic regression\nmodel adjusting for multiple potential risk factors and chronic conditions which may have a deleterious effect on disease outcomes (including age, sex,\nsmoking, IHD, SES, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, CVA, CHF, chronic lung disease, and obesity), only HbA1c \u2265 nine\npercent remained a significant predictor for hospitalization.\u201d Given the evidence, the researchers\u00a0urge \u201cPaying special attention to patients with\ndiabetes and an HbA1c \u2265 nine while allowing a more lenient approach to patients with well controlled disease,\u201d as this can reduce economic, social, and\npatient burden, especially for those who are at the greatest risk for reacting severely to COVID-19.\nXie, et al. (2021) investigated the role of FPG and glucose fluctuation on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients who already had prior diagnoses of\ndiabetes. Through a multivariate Cox analysis, the researchers found that FPG was \u201can independent prognostic factor of overall survival after\nadjustment for age, sex, diabetes, and severity of COVID-19 at admission (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25).\u201d However, blood glucose fluctuation was\nassociated with COVID-19 disease progression, as proven by the results found from the indices of the standard deviation of blood glucose and the\nlargest amplitude of glycemic excursions. Both FPG and blood glucose fluctuation indices were also found to be positively associated with increased\npresence of inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19, such as the \u201cwhite blood cell absolute count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, alkaline\nphosphatase, a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-hbdh), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase, [and] D-dimer.\u201d Ultimately, it was\nconcluded that diabetes was not an independent risk factor for in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients, as these findings were identified regardless of\ndiabetes status.\nYang, et al. (2019) aimed to find the appropriate threshold for FPG for defining prediabetes among children and adolescents. The sample was selected\nfrom school-aged children in Taiwan via a nationwide survey administered between 1992-2000, who then underwent physical examinations and blood\ntests if they exhibited abnormal urine test findings. The researchers found that the incidence of pediatric diabetes increased with increasing fasting\nplasma glucose levels, and those with FPG > 5.6mmol/L had higher adjusted hazard ratios. Additionally, \u201cthe association between fasting plasma\nglucose and incident pediatric diabetes and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were similar in boys and girls and were higher in\nthe age group twelve to eighteen years.\u201d In using 4.75 mmol/L as the optimal threshold for children six to eleven years, the sensitivity was 65% and\nspecificity was 51%. For the threshold of 5.19 mmol/L among children twelve to eighteen years, the sensitivity was 60% and the specificity was 73%.\nThis supports utilizing FPG as a supplement for diagnosing prediabetes among pediatric patients, which may contribute to better disease management.\nGeifman-Holtzman, et al. (2010) assessed the correlation between fetal macrosomia and abnormal OGTT in pregnant individuals with term gestation and\nnegative glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24 to 28 weeks. They recruited patients who had estimated fetal weights >90th percentile and a negative 50g\nGCT. From 170 individuals over a five-month period, they found that 10 patients or 5.9% had \u201cimpaired glucose metabolism at term.\u201d In this group, \u201cwe\nfound no correlation between GCT values at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks, family history of diabetes mellitus, the patient\u2019s [body mass index] or\nweight at term, and the diagnosis of impaired glucose metabolism.\u201d Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in mean fetal weight\nbetween those with normal versus abnormal OGTT. This demonstrated the lack of clinical utility of using OGTT at term for predicting the incidence of\nfetal macrosomia. The researchers suggested utilizing a larger scale study to solidify or contradict these conclusions.\nBi, et al. (2024) engaged in a cross-sectional study of participants aged >20 years old who underwent physical examination at the local hospital from\n2022 to 2023. A model was used to assess the dose-response relationship between liver enzymes and type 2 diabetes risk. Of the 14,100 participants,\nan analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between liver enzymes and\u00a0type 2 diabetes risk (P non-linear < 0.001). Specifically, type 2 diabetes risk\nincreased with rising ALT and GGT levels (range, <50 IU/L) and then leveled out when ALT and GGT levels were >50 IU/L. An elevated AST within a\ncertain range (range, <35 IU/L) decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes, but a mildly elevated AST (>35 IU/L) showed as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\nIn conclusion, liver enzymes were associated non-linearly with type 2 diabetes risk in different populations. Higher ALT and GGT levels were shown in\nthis study to increase type 2 diabetes risk as well. In conclusion, additional attention should be paid to elevated liver enzymes and diabetes, but more\nwork also needs to be done to assess association between elevation and T2D risk.\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA)\nThe ADA publishes an extensive guideline encompassing the standards of medical care in diabetes.

An A1C of <7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate for many children\u201d Grade B.\nPregnancy (Ch 15)\n\u201c\u2026although A1c may be useful, it should be used as a secondary measure of glycemic control in pregnancy, after blood glucose monitoring.\u201d\n\u201cFasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring are recommended in individuals with diabetes in pregnancy to achieve optimal\nglucose levels. Glucose goals are fasting plasma glucose <95 mg/dL (<5.3 mmol/L) and either 1-h postprandial glucose <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L)\nor 2-h postprandial glucose <120 mg/dL (<6.7 mmol/L) Grade B\u201d\n\u201cDue to increased red blood cell turnover, A1C is slightly lower during pregnancy in people with and without diabetes. Ideally, the A1C goal in\npregnancy is <6% (<42 mmol/mol) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, but the goal may be relaxed to <7% (<53 mmol/mol) if\nnecessary to prevent hypoglycemia Grade B\u201d\n\u201cGiven the alteration in red blood cell kinetics during pregnancy and physiological changes in glycemic parameters, A1c levels may need \u201cto be\nmonitored more frequently than usual (e.g., monthly).\u201d\n\u201cThe OGTT is recommended over A1C at four to twelve weeks postpartum because A1C may be persistently impacted (lowered) by the increased\nred blood cell turnover related to pregnancy, by blood loss at delivery, or by the preceding three-month glucose profile. The OGTT is more\nsensitive at detecting glucose intolerance, including both prediabetes and diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cBecause GDM often represents previously undiagnosed prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, or even developing\ntype 1 diabetes, individuals with GDM should be tested for persistent diabetes or prediabetes at four to twelve weeks postpartum with a fasting\n75-g OGTT using nonpregnancy criteria as outlined in Section two, \u201cClassification and Diagnosis of Diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, a positive screen for diabetes requires two abnormal values. If both the fasting plasma glucose\n(\u2265126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L]) and 2-h plasma glucose (\u2265200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]) are abnormal in a single screening test, then the diagnosis of\ndiabetes is made. If only one abnormal value in the OGTT meets diabetes criteria, the test should be repeated to confirm that the abnormality\npersists.\u201d\n\u201cIndividuals with a history of GDM should have ongoing screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes every 1\u20133 years, even if the results of the\ninitial 4\u201312 week postpartum 75-g OGTT are normal. Ongoing evaluation may be performed with any recommended glycemic test (e.g., annual\nA1C, annual fasting plasma glucose, or triennial 75-g OGTT using thresholds for nonpregnant individuals).\u201d\nHeart Failure Considerations (ch. 10)\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals, routine screening for coronary artery disease is not recommended, as it does not improve outcomes as long as\nASCVD risk factors are treated.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cConsider investigations for coronary artery disease in the presence of any of the following: atypical cardiac symptoms; signs or symptoms of\nassociated vascular disease, including carotid bruits, transient ischemic attack, stroke, claudication, or PAD; or electrocardiogram abnormalities\n(e.g., Q waves).\u201d Grade E\n\u201cAdults with diabetes are at increased risk for the development of asymptomatic cardiac structural or functional abnormalities (stage B heart\nfailure) or symptomatic (stage C) heart failure. Consider screening adults with diabetes by measuring a natriuretic peptide (B-type natriuretic\npeptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-BNP [NTproBNP]) to facilitate prevention of stage C heart failure.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and abnormal natriuretic peptide levels, echocardiography is recommended to identify stage B heart\nfailure.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and age \u226550 years, microvascular disease in any location, or foot complications or any end-organ\ndamage from diabetes, screening for PAD with ankle-brachial index testing is recommended to guide treatment for cardiovascular disease\nprevention and limb preservation. A In individuals with diabetes duration \u226510 years, screening for PAD should be considered\u201d Grade B.\nNonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis & Chronic Kidney Disease (ch. 4 and ch. 11)\nFrom chapter 4:\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, particularly those with obesity or cardiometabolic risk factors or established cardiovascular disease,\nshould be screened/risk stratified for clinically significant liver fibrosis (defined as moderate fibrosis to cirrhosis) using a calculated fibrosis-4\nindex (FIB-4) (derived from age, ALT, AST, and platelets\u2026even if they have normal liver enzymes.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with diabetes or prediabetes with persistently elevated plasma aminotransferase levels for >6 months and low FIB-4 should be evaluated\nfor other causes of liver disease.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with an indeterminate or high FIB-4 should have additional risk stratification by liver stiffness\nmeasurement with transient elastography or the blood biomarker enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF).\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with indeterminate results or at high risk for significant liver fibrosis (i.e., by FIB-4, liver stiffness\nmeasurement, or ELF) should be referred to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for further workup. Interprofessional care is recommended for\nlong-term management Grade B.\u201d\nFrom chapter 11:\nAdditionally: \u201cA screening strategy based on elevated plasma aminotransferases >40 units/L would miss most individuals with NASH in these settings,\nas clinically significant fibrosis (\u2265F2) is frequently observed with plasma aminotransferases below the commonly used cutoff of 40 units/L. The American\nCollege of Gastroenterology considers the upper limit of normal ALT levels to be 29\u201333 units/L for male individuals and 19\u201325 units/L for female\nindividuals, as higher levels are associated with increased liver-related mortality, even in the absence of identifiable risk factors. The FIB-4 estimates\nthe risk of hepatic cirrhosis and is calculated from the computation of age, plasma aminotransferases (AST and ALT), and platelet count.\u201d\nIn regards to A1c and NASH, the ADA restricts its comments to the following: \u201cThe only proven primary prevention interventions for CKD in people with\ndiabetes are blood glucose (A1C goal of 7%) and blood pressure control (blood pressure <130/80 mmHg),\u201d and \u201cIntensive lowering of blood glucose with\nthe goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large, randomized studies to delay the onset and progression of albuminuria and reduce\neGFR in people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Insulin alone was used to lower blood glucose in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial\n(DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study of type 1 diabetes, while a variety of agents were used in clinical trials of type\n2 diabetes, supporting the conclusion that lowering blood glucose itself helps prevent CKD and its progression. The effects of glucose-lowering\ntherapies on CKD have helped define A1C goals.\u201d\nHospital Care Delivery Standards and Perioperative Care (ch. 16)\n49\n50\n51\n52,53\n54\n54\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n8/15\n\u201cPerform an A1C test on all people with diabetes or hyperglycemia (random blood glucose >140 mg/dL [>7.8 mmol/L]) admitted to the hospital if\nno A1C test result is available from the prior 3 months.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn hospitalized individuals with diabetes who are eating, point-of-care (POC) blood glucose monitoring should be performed before meals; in\nthose not eating, glucose monitoring is advised every 4\u20136 h. More frequent POC blood glucose monitoring ranging from every 30 min to every 2 h\nis the required standard for safe use of intravenous insulin therapy.\u201d (No grade; statement)\nThe following approach may be considered for those in preoperative and perioperative care:\n\u201cA preoperative risk assessment should be performed for people with diabetes who are at high risk for ischemic heart disease and those with\nautonomic neuropathy or renal failure.\nThe A1C goal for elective surgeries should be <8% (<63.9 mmol/L) whenever possible.\nThe blood glucose goal in the perioperative period should be 100\u2013180 mg/dL (5.6\u201310.0 mmol/L) within 4 h of the surgery. CGM should not be\nused alone for glucose monitoring during surgery.\nMetformin should be held on the day of surgery.\nSGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued 3\u20134 days before surgery.\nHold other oral glucose-lowering agents the morning of surgery or procedure and give one-half of NPH dose or 75\u201380% doses of long-acting\nanalog insulin or adjust insulin pump basal rates based on the type of diabetes and clinical judgment.\nMonitor blood glucose at least every 2\u20134 h while the individual takes nothing by mouth and dose with short- or rapid-acting insulin as needed.\nThere is little data on the safe use and/or influence of GLP-1 receptor agonists on glycemia and delayed gastric emptying in the perioperative\nperiod.\nStricter perioperative glycemic goals are not advised, as perioperative glycemic goals stricter than 80\u2013180 mg/dL (4.4\u201310.0 mmol/L) may not\nimprove outcomes and are associated with more hypoglycemia.\nCompared with usual dosing, a reduction by 25% of basal insulin given the evening before surgery is more likely to achieve perioperative blood\nglucose goals with a lower risk for hypoglycemia.\nIn individuals undergoing noncardiac general surgery, basal insulin plus premeal short- or rapid-acting insulin (basal-bolus) coverage has been\nassociated with improved glycemic outcomes and lower rates of perioperative complications compared with the reactive, correction-only short- or\nrapid-acting insulin coverage alone with no basal insulin dosing.\u201d\nThe ADA did not specifically mention \u201cbariatric surgery\u201d in their hospital care delivery section (ch. 16).\nDiabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee\nThis Expert Committee published a comprehensive guideline on the prevention and management of diabetes. Relevant items, recommendations, and\ncomments\u2014particularly those relating to the use of A1c testing\u2014are captured below:\n\u201cScreen for type 2 diabetes using a fasting plasma glucose and/or glycated hemoglobin (A1C) every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or\nin individuals at high risk on a risk calculator (33% chance of developing diabetes over ten years).\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of evidence for interventions to prevent or delay type 1 diabetes, routine screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended.\u201d\n\u201cFor most individuals with diabetes, A1C should be measured approximately every three months to ensure that glycemic goals are being met or\nmaintained. In some circumstances, such as when significant changes are made to therapy, or during pregnancy, it is appropriate to check A1C\nmore frequently. Testing at least every six months should be performed in adults during periods of treatment and healthy behavior stability when\nglycemic targets have been consistently achieved.\u201d\nA1C can be misleading in various medical conditions (\u201ce.g., hemoglobinopathies, iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia, severe hepatic or renal\ndisease\u201d) and should not be used for \u201cdiagnostic use in children and adolescents (as the sole diagnostic test), pregnant [individuals] as part of\nroutine screening for gestational diabetes, those with cystic fibrosis or those with suspected type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nDiabetes \u201cshould\u201d be diagnosed at a level of A1C \u22656.5%.\n\u201cScreening for diabetes using FPG and/or A1C should be performed every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or at high risk using a risk\ncalculator [Grade D, Consensus]. Earlier testing and/or more frequent follow up (every six to twelve months) with either FPG and/or A1C should\nbe considered in those at very high risk using a risk calculator or in people with additional risk factors for diabetes [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d\nIt should be mentioned that \u201cGlycemic targets should be individualized [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d based upon various considerations including, but not\nlimited to, the patient\u2019s functional dependence, medical history, life expectancy, and life course stage. Moreover, the grading of recommendations above\n(e.g., \u201cGrade D\u201d) reflect the methodological rigor used at arriving at the conclusion, such that lower grades reflect the presence of weaker evidence. But\nthough the \u201cpaucity of clinical evidence addressing the areas of therapy, prevention, diagnosis or prognosis precluded the assignment of a higher\ngrade,\u201d the authors recognize and note that many Grade D recommendations are \u201cvery important to the contemporary management of diabetes.\u201d\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)\nThe USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who are overweight or obese, and such\n\u201cScreening tests for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes include measurement of fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c level or an oral glucose tolerance test.\u201d\nRecognizing that \u201cThe optimal screening interval for adults with an initial normal glucose test result is uncertain,\u201d the USPSTF suggests that \u201cScreening\nevery three years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels.\u201d\nThe USPSTF has also provided guidelines pertaining to the screening of gestational diabetes. For asymptomatic pregnant persons at 24 weeks\ngestation or after, with a letter \u201cB\u201d grade, the USPSTF recommends screening for gestational diabetes in this population. However, in asymptomatic\npregnant persons before 24 weeks gestation, the USPSTF states that \u201ccurrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of\nscreening\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nAn \u201cI\u201d grade is defined by the USPSTF as \u201cI Statement- The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits\nand harms cannot be determined.\u201d\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n9/15\nIn 2022, the USPSTF released its first recommendation on screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. This recommendation applies to\nchildren and adolescents who are not pregnant and who are younger than 18 years of age without known diabetes or prediabetes and who are without\nsymptoms of diabetes or prediabetes. The USPSTF states that the goal of screening for type 2 diabetes in young people is \u201cto diagnose and treat it\nearly to prevent development of bad health outcomes. However, no studies have looked at the link between screening for type 2 diabetes in children and\nadolescents and bad health outcomes. Studies about the effect of type 2 diabetes treatment on health outcomes in children and adolescents have not\nhad enough patients with bad outcomes to draw any meaningful conclusions. No studies have looked at harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in young\npeople. Potential harms may include side effects from medications used to treat diabetes, such as low blood glucose, nausea, or vomiting.\u201d Based on\nthe current evidence for asymptomatic children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age, the USPSTF concluded that \u201ccurrent evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)\nThe Global Report on Diabetes states that: \u201cGlycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the method of choice for monitoring glycaemic control in diabetes. An\nadvantage of using HbA1c is that the patient does not need to be in a fasting state. Ideally it should be measured twice a year in people\u00a0with type 2\ndiabetes and more frequently in those with type 1 diabetes. However, HbA1c testing is more costly than glucose measurement, and therefore less\nreadily available. If HbA1c testing is not available, fasting, or post-meal blood glucose is an acceptable substitute.\u201d\nThe WHO also published a \u201cmodule\u201d titled \u201cHearts-D: Diagnosis and Management of Type 2 Diabetes in 2020. In it, a testing algorithm for \u201ctreatment of\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin\u201d is included at the bottom. The algorithm calls for an HbA1c assessment to be performed \u201cin three months\u201d if the\npatient is stabilized as a result of the insulin treatment.\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)\nIn 2022, the AAFP published a clinical summary of the USPSTF recommendation for screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The\ndocument deferred to the USPSTF recommendations, with the testing audience being \u201cNonpregnant adults aged thirty-five to seventy years who have\noverweight or obesity and no symptoms of diabetes\u201d\u2014a move from 40 years of age in the previous recommendation\u2014while deeming screening every\nthree years to be a reasonable approach.\nEndocrine Society\nThe Endocrine Society published this guideline regarding management of diabetes in older adults. In it, they recommend screening for prediabetes or\ndiabetes every two years for patients 65 years or older. FPG and/or HbA1c may be used. However, the Society does recommend caution when\ninterpreting HbA1c results, as older patients are more likely to have conditions that alter red blood cell turnover.\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\nNICE published an update to their guideline on diabetes management. In it, they make the following recommendations:\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c levels in adults with type 2 diabetes every:\nThree to six months (tailored to individual needs) until HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy.\nSix months once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable.\u201d\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c using methods calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardization.\u201d\n\u201cIf HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type, estimate trends in blood glucose control using\none of the following:\nquality-controlled plasma glucose profiles\ntotal glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)\nfructosamine estimation.\u201d\n\u201cInvestigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes\nor clinical biochemistry.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)\nThe AACE provides the following inclusion criteria for individuals who should be screened for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes:\nAge \u226545 years without other risk factors\nCVD or family history of T2D\nOverweight or obese\nSedentary lifestyle\nMember of an at-risk racial or ethnic group:\nAsian\nAfrican American\nHispanic\nNative American (Alaska Natives and American Indians)\nPacific Islander\nHigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level >250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L)\nImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and/or metabolic syndrome\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), acanthosis nigricans, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\nHypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg or on antihypertensive therapy)\nHistory of gestational diabetes or delivery of a baby weighing more than 5 kg (9 lb)\nAntipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia and/or severe bipolar disease\nChronic glucocorticoid exposure\nSleep disorders in the presence of glucose intolerance (A1C >5.7%, IGT, or IFG on previous testing), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),\nchronic sleep deprivation, and night-shift occupation\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n10/15\nThe AACE recommends repeat testing at least every three years for individuals with normal results. Consider annual screening for patients with two or\nmore risk factors.\nIn a 2022 update focusing on developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan, the AACE expounds on how the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus\nshould be made. According to the authors, the ELs refer to evidence levels established by AACE evidence ratings, where \u201cdescriptors of \u201cmust,\u201d\n\u201cshould,\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d generally but not strictly correlate with Grade A (strong), Grade B (intermediate), and Grade C (weak) recommendations,\nrespectively.\u201d\nThe relevant recommendations are captured below.\n\u201cRecommendation 1.1\nThe diagnosis of DM is based on the following criteria\u2026:\nFPG concentration \u2265126 mg/dL (after \u2265 eight hours of an overnight fast), or\nPlasma glucose (PG) concentration \u2265200 mg/dL two hours after ingesting a 75-g oral glucose load after an overnight fast of at least eight hours,\nor\nSymptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia) and a random (nonfasting) PG concentration \u2265200 mg/dL, or\nA1C level \u22656.5%\nDiagnosis of DM requires two abnormal test results, either from the same sample or two abnormal results on samples drawn on different days. However,\na glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms for DM confirms the diagnosis of DM.\nGrade A; BEL 2 and expert opinion of task force\nRecommendation 1.2\nPrediabetes is identified by the presence of IFG (100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), which is a PG value of 140 to 199 mg/dL two\nhours after ingesting 75 g of glucose, and/or A1C value between 5.7% and 6.4% (Table 4). A1C should be used only for screening for prediabetes. The\ndiagnosis of prediabetes, which may manifest as either IFG or IGT, should be confirmed with glucose testing.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.3\nT1D is characterized by marked insulin deficiency in the presence of hyperglycemia and positive autoantibody tests to glutamic acid decarboxylase\n(GAD65), pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells (tyrosine phosphatase IA-2), and IA-2b zinc transporter (ZnT8), and/or insulin. The presence of immune markers and\nclinical presentation are needed to establish the correct diagnosis and to distinguish between T1D and T2D in children or adults, as well as to determine\nappropriate treatment.\nGrade A; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.4\nT2D is characterized by progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion and variable defects in insulin sensitivity. T2D is often asymptomatic and can remain\nundiagnosed for many years; therefore, all adults \u226535 years of age with risk factors should be screened for DM (Table 5).\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.5\nGDM is defined as carbohydrate intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy and resolves postpartum. Pregnant individuals with risk\nfactors for DM should be screened at the first prenatal visit for undiagnosed T2D using standard criteria (Table 4).\nGrade B; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.6\nScreen all pregnant individuals for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Diagnose GDM with either the one-step or the two-step\napproach.\nThe one-step approach uses a two-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after \u2265 eight hours of fasting with diagnostic cutoffs of one or\nmore FPG \u226592 mg/dL, one-hour PG \u2265180 mg/dL, or two-hour PG \u2265153 mg/dL.\nThe two-step approach uses a nonfasting one-hour 50-g glucose challenge test with one-hour PG screening threshold of 130 or 140 mg/dL. For\nindividuals with a positive screening test, the three-hour 100-g OGTT is used for diagnosis with two or more PG tests that meet the following\nthresholds: FPG \u226595 mg/dL, 1-hour \u2265180 mg/dL, 2-hour \u2265155 mg/dL, 3-hour \u2265140 mg/dL.\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.7\nClinicians should consider evaluation for monogenic DM in any child or young adult with an atypical presentation, clinical course, or response to\ntherapy. Monogenic DM includes neonatal diabetes and nonautoimmune diabetes of multiple genetic causes, also known as maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young (MODY). Most children with DM occurring under six months of age have a monogenic cause as autoimmune T1D rarely occurs before six\nmonths of age. Other monogenic forms of diabetes are characterized by mutation of genes of transcription factors, genes regulating pancreatic\ndevelopment or atrophy, abnormal insulin genes, genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress that impair insulin secretion, or abnormal glucokinase\ngenes that cause impaired insulin signaling.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nAlthough not expressly listed as recommendations for diabetes screening, some additional information of note includes the following:\n\u201cA glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of hyperglycemia symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia confirm the diagnosis of DM. In\nindividuals with discordant results from two different tests, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated on a different\nday.\u201d\n\u201cIn view of physiological changes in pregnancy that could affect glycated hemoglobin levels, A1C should not be used for GDM screening or\ndiagnosis of DM.\u201d\n66\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n11/15\n\u201cAll pregnant individuals should be screened for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Universal screening is recommended, as\nselective screening (only in individuals with risk factors) would miss a significant number of individuals with GDM and universal screening has\nbeen shown to be cost-effective compared with selective screening.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE)\nThe 2020 Consensus Statement from the AACE/ACE on the Management of Type 2 Diabetes states:\n\"The hemoglobin A1c (A1c) target should be individualized based on numerous factors such as age, life expectancy, comorbid conditions,\nduration of diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia or adverse consequences from hypoglycemia, patient motivation, and adherence.\"\n\u201cAn A1c level of \u22646.5% is considered optimal if it can be achieved in a safe and affordable manner, but higher targets may be appropriate for\ncertain individuals and may change for a given individual over time.\u201d\n\u201cTherapy must be evaluated frequently (e.g., every three months) until stable using multiple criteria, including A1c, SMBG records (fasting and\npostprandial) or continuous glucose monitoring tracings, documented and suspected hypoglycemia events, lipid and BP values, adverse events\n(weight gain, fluid retention, hepatic or renal impairment, or CVD), comorbidities, other relevant laboratory data, concomitant drug administration,\ncomplications of diabetes, and psychosocial factors affecting patient care. Less frequent monitoring is acceptable once targets are achieved.\u201d\nIn 2023, the AACE/ACE released \u201cGuidelines and Recommendations for Laboratory Analysis in the Diagnosis and Management of Diabetes Mellitus.\u201d\nDiagnosis related recommendations:\n\u201cFasting glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used to establish the diagnosis of diabetes, with a value \u22657.0 mmol/L (\u2265126 mg/dL)\ndiagnostic of diabetes. A (high)\u201d\nScreening related recommendations:\n\u201cRecommendation: Screening by HbA1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT is recommended for individuals who are at high risk of diabetes. If HbA1c is <5.7%\n(<39 mmol/mol), FPG is <5.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL), and/or 2-h plasma glucose is <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year\nintervals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used for screening of high-risk individuals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Plasma glucose should be measured in an accredited laboratory when used for diagnosis of or screening for diabetes. GPP\n(good practice point)\u201d\nMonitoring/Prognosis:\n\u201cRecommendation: Routine measurement of plasma glucose concentrations in a laboratory is not recommended as the primary means of\nmonitoring or evaluating therapy in individuals with diabetes. B (moderate)\u201d\nKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Diabetes Working Group\nThe KDIGO group published recommendations on diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). They recommend using HbA1c to monitor diabetic and\nCKD patients twice a year or as often as four times a year if glycemic target is not met or a change is made in therapy. KDIGO advises that \"accuracy\nand precision of HbA1c measurement declines with advanced CKD, particularly among patients treated by dialysis, in whom HbA1c measurements have\nlow reliability.\" They also recommend an \"individualized HbA1c target ranging from <6.5% to <8.0% in patients with diabetes and CKD not treated with\ndialysis.\u201d\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a condition where there is a buildup of fat in the liver.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\nPrevalence: In 2021, 38.4 million Americans, or 11.6% of the population, had diabetes. Approximately 1.9 million American children and adults\nhave type 1 diabetes, including about 244,000 children and adolescents.\nDiagnosed and undiagnosed: Of the 38.4 million, 29.7 million were diagnosed, and 8.7 million were undiagnosed.\nPrevalence in seniors: The percentage of Americans aged 65 and older remains high, at 29.2%, or 15.9 million seniors (diagnosed and\nundiagnosed).\nNew cases: 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year.\nPrediabetes: In 2021, 97.6 million Americans aged eighteen and older had prediabetes.\nDeaths: Diabetes remains the 8th leading cause of death in the United States in 2021, with 103,294 death certificates listing it as the underlying\ncause of death, and a total of 399.401 death certificates listing diabetes as a cause of death.\nTotal economic cost of diabetes care in the United States: $413 billion in 2022.\nDiabetes can be classified into the following categories:\n\u201cType 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune \u03b2-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency)\u201d\n\u201cType 2 diabetes (due to a progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background of insulin resistance)\u201d\n\u201cGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior\nto gestation)\u201d\n\u201cSpecific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young [MODY]), diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as\nwith glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, or after organ transplantation)\u201d  The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is easily established\nwhen a patient presents with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, which include polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, blurred vision, and, infrequently,\nweight loss. The frequency of symptomatic diabetes has been decreasing in parallel with improved efforts to diagnose diabetes earlier through\nscreening. Increasingly, the majority of patients are asymptomatic, and hyperglycemia is noted on routine laboratory evaluation, prompting further\ntesting.\n6,7\n8\n3\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n3/15\nGlycated hemoglobin A1c (also known as HbA1c, A1c, glycohemoglobin, or hemoglobin A1c) testing plays a key role in the management of diabetes.\nNew hemoglobin enters circulation with minimal glucose attached. However, glucose irreversibly binds to hemoglobin based on the surrounding blood\nglucose concentration. Therefore, A1c is considered a measure of blood glucose level, albeit an indirect one. It is best correlated with the mean glucose\nlevel over the last eight to twelve weeks as red blood cells experience significant turnover. Various factors may affect the reliability of A1c (atypical\nhemoglobins or hemoglobinopathies, chronic kidney disease, et al.), but most assays have been standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications\nTrial (DCCT) standard, which \u201cestimated the mean blood glucose concentrations derived from seven measurements a day (before and ninety minutes\nafter each of the three major\u00a0meals, and before bedtime), performed once every three months and compared the average glucose concentration with\nA1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nThe HbA1c assay provides information about the degree of long-term glucose control,  and has been recommended for the diagnosis and monitoring of\ndiabetes.\nVarious methods of HbA1c measurement include chromatography based HPLC assay, boronate affinity, antibody-based immunoassay, and\nenzyme based enzymatic assay.\nLong-term blood sugar control has been associated with decreased risk of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and\ncardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial, cerebrovascular disease,\nand myocardial fibrosis in adults with diabetes.\nHigher HbA1c variability has\nbeen associated with higher all-cause mortality in patients with Type 2 Diabetes.\nFasting plasma glucose is a method of glucose monitoring that measures an individual\u2019s glucose level typically in a period defined with no caloric intake\nfor eight hours or more. Its usage in the diagnosis of diabetes lies primarily in gestational diabetes, along with the OGTT, but HbA1c, FPG, or OGTTs\nwith their respective positive results can be used in diagnosing diabetes mellitus in nonpregnant individuals as well. To diagnose diabetes in\nasymptomatic individuals, a FPG has to be \u2265 126 mg/dL. For diagnosing prediabetes, an individual may have \u201cimpaired fasting glucose,\u201d which would\npresent with a range of 100-125 mg/Dl.\nTraditionally, the diagnosis of diabetes was predicated on plasma glucose levels as well as symptom presentation. In 2010, the ADA endorsed as a\n\u201creliable retrospective marker of blood glucose control over the past 6-8 weeks.\u201d The advantages of HbA1c testing include increased convenience,\nincreased stability and decreased variation in measurement. While the ADA 2023 guidelines gave precedence to FPG, the latest 2024 guideline\naddressed the vital importance of HbA1c for both diagnostic and screening purposes (for both diabetes and prediabetes care).\nThe ADA notes that there are areas where HbA1c is insufficient and plasma glucose levels are the preferred measurement: \u201cIn the presence of\nhemoglobin variants, pregnancy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and other conditions that might potentially interfere with accurate\nHbA1c measurements, plasma glucose levels are preferred. Furthermore, in situations where elevated blood glucose levels might not be consistently\napparent, the diagnosis of diabetes necessitates two abnormal test results (HbA1c and plasma glucose) either simultaneously or at different time points.\nIn such scenarios, alternative biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin emerge as viable options for monitoring glycemic status.\nFructosamine reflects the total pool of glycated serum proteins, mainly albumin, reflecting glycemic trends over a span of two to four weeks\u2014a relatively\nshorter duration compared to A1C. Although these biomarkers show a strong correlation and are associated with long-term complications based on\nepidemiological evidence, the empirical support for their application is not as robust as that for HbA1c.\u201d\nThe OGTT can be more inconvenient and used in the setting to diagnose GDM. Normally, 75g of glucose is ingested by the patient, and if the patient\nhas a two-hour plasma glucose value of \u2265200 mg/dL, a diagnosis of diabetes can be made. The test can also be performed at one-hour with 50g oral\nglucose, with positive GDM diagnostic results between 130-140 mg/dL as part of a two-step approach with the three-hour 100g test, which can be\ndiagnostic of GDM with two elevated values. For prediabetes with an accompanied \u201cimpaired glucose tolerance,\u201d a two-hour plasma glucose value\nbetween 140-199 mg/dL is used. However, the WHO requires an additional FPG <126 in addition to the two-hour plasma glucose value to establish\nimpaired glucose tolerance.\nAnalytical Validity\nThe International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Working Group on HbA1c Standardization has developed a reference\nmeasurement system and the measurement of HbA1c is currently well-standardized,\nand a sound reference system is in place to ensure continuity and\nstability of the analytical validity of HbA1c measurement.\nIn contrast, plasma glucose concentration remains difficult to assay with consistent\naccuracy.\nHbA1c has greater analytical stability (consistency with repetitive sample testing) and less day-to-day variability than either the fasting\nplasma glucose (FPG)or two-hour PG.\nFor any given individual, the HbA1c exhibits little short-term biologic variability; its coefficient of variation\n(CV) is 3.6%, compared to FPG (CV of 5.7%) and 2-h PG (CV of 16.6%).\nA sample proficiency testing survey performed by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and College of American Pathologists\n(CAP) evaluated the accuracy of A1c assays. The survey found that \u201cmethod-specific, between-laboratory CV\u2019s ranged from 0.7% to 4.0%\u201d and\n\u201capproximately 85% of laboratories are using methods with CVs <3% at all five HbA1c levels.\u201d The survey also noted the current pass limit was \u00b16%, but\nusing a pass rate of 97.1% to 98.0% of labs passed.\nClinical Utility and Validity\nTesting A1c, FPG, and 2-h PG measure different aspects of glycemia and are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1c \u22656.5% identifies fewer\nindividuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria; however, a recent study concluded that twelve percent of patients can be misclassified with\nrespect to diabetes diagnosis due to laboratory instrument error in measuring glucose.\nThe New Hoorn Study analyzed the diagnostic properties of the\nA1c, using OGTT as the diagnostic criterion.\nThe analysis suggested that an A1c of 5.8% had a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 91%. This\ncompares with specificity of 24% and sensitivity of 99% for the A1c cut point of 6.5%. On the other hand, the 6.5% cut point had a positive predictive\nvalue of 93%, compared with a positive predictive value of only 24% for a cut point of 5.8%.\nWhen using the reference diagnosis of diabetes being a two-hour blood glucose >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT, the specificity of FPG \u2265126\nmg/dL was >95% and sensitivity about 50%, with possibly lower sensitivities and specificities for individuals over 65 years.27 With the same OGTT\nreference, the specificity and sensitivity of an A1c \u22656.5%, as per diagnosis of diabetes, were reported as 79% and 44%, respectively.\nCowie, et al. (2010) \u201cexamined prevalence\u2019s of previously diagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes and high risk for diabetes using recently\nsuggested A1c criteria in the U.S. during 2003\u20132006. We compared these prevalence\u2019s to those in earlier surveys and those using glucose criteria.\u201d\n14,611 individuals were included (completed a household interview) and classified for diagnosed diabetes and by A1c, fasting, and 2-h glucose\nchallenge values. Diagnostic values for A1c were \u22656.5% for \u201cundiagnosed\u201d diabetes and 6%-6.5% for \u201chigh risk\u201d of diabetes. The authors found that by\nthese A1c diagnostic values, the \u201ccrude prevalence\u201d of diabetes in adults older than twenty years was 20.4 million, of which nineteen percent went\nundiagnosed based on A1c \u2265 6.5%. The authors then stated that the A1c criteria only diagnosed thirty percent of the undiagnosed diabetic group.\n5\n9\n8,10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n3,4\n15\n4,16\n17\n18\n19\n20,21\n22,23\n24\n25\n26\n22\n28\n29\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n4/15\nMamtora, et al. (2021) assessed the clinical utility of point-of-care (POC) HbA1c testing in the ophthalmology outpatient setting. Forty-nine patients with\ndiabetic retinopathy underwent POC HbA1c testing and blood pressure measurement. Of the 49 patients, 81.6% had POC readings above the\nrecommended HbA1c levels and only 16.3% of these patients were aware of their elevated HbA1c levels. Fourteen patients (33.3%) with high HbA1c\nreadings were referred to secondary diabetic services and 88.8% of patients felt like the test was useful. The authors suggest that POC HbA1c testing is\na \"cost-effective, reproducible and clinically significant tool for the management of diabetes in an outpatient ophthalmology setting, allowing the rapid\nrecognition of high-risk patients and appropriate referral to secondary diabetic services.\"\nGoodney, et al. (2016) evaluated the consistency of A1c testing of diabetes patients and its effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The study included\n1574415 Medicare patients with diabetes mellitus, and the consistency of testing was separated into three categories: \u201clow (testing in zero or one of\nthree years), medium (testing in two of three years), and high (testing in all three years).\u201d Approximately 70.2% of patients received high-consistency\ntesting, 17.6% received medium-consistency, and 12.2% received low-consistency. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) included \u201cdeath,\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, amputation, or the need for leg revascularization.\u201d Low-consistency patients was associated with death or other adverse\nevents (hazard ratio: 1.21). The authors concluded that \u201cconsistent annual hemoglobin A1c testing is associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular\noutcomes in this observational cohort of Medicare patients of diabetes mellitus.\u201d\nThe GOAL study used A1c to assess diabetes control in a real-world practice study aimed to assess predictive factors for achieving the glycemic\nhemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at six months as targeted by the treating physician in adults with type 2 diabetes. In this study, 2704 patients with a mean A1c\nof 9.7% were enrolled. After six months, lower baseline A1c (\u2265 8.5% vs <7%) was found to be a predictive factor for achieving glycemic control. The\nauthors also observed \u201cabsolute changes in the mean HbA1c of \u22121.7% and \u22122% were observed from baseline to six and twelve months, respectively.\u201d\nMitsios, et al. (2018) evaluated the association between A1c and stroke risk. Twenty-nine studies (n=532779) were included. The authors compared the\nnon-diabetic A1c range (<5.7%) to the diabetic range (\u22656.5%) and found that the diabetic range was associated with a 2.15-fold increased risk of first-\never stroke. The prediabetes range of 5.7%-6.5% was also not associated with first-ever stroke. The authors also observed that for every one percent\nincrease in A1c, the hazard ratio of first-ever stroke increased (1.12-fold for non-diabetic ranges, 1.17 for diabetic ones). This increased risk was also\nseen for ischemic stroke, with a hazard ratio of 1.49 for non-diabetic ranges and 1.24 for diabetic ranges.\nLudvigsson, et al. (2019) evaluated the association between preterm birth risk and periconceptional HbA1c levels in pregnant individuals with type 1\ndiabetes (T1D). Preterm birth was defined as <37 weeks and several secondary outcomes were also examined, which were \u201cneonatal death, large-for-\ngestational age, macrosomia, infant birth injury, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, five-minute Apgar score less than seven, and stillbirth.\u201d A total of\n2474 singletons born to individuals with T1D and 1165216 reference infants (children born to mothers without T1D) were included. The authors identified\n552 preterm births in the T1D cohort (22.3%) compared to 54287 in the control cohort (4.7%). Incidences of preterm birth were measured at several\nseparate thresholds, including <6.5%, 6.5%-7.8%, 7.8%-9.1%, and >9.1%. The T1D cohort\u2019s adjusted risk ratios (aRR) of preterm birth compared to the\ncontrol cohort were as\u00a0follows: 2.83 for <6.5%, 4.22 for 6.5%-7.8%, 5.56 for 7.8%-9.1%, and 6.91 for >9.1%. The corresponding aRRs for \u201cmedically\nindicated preterm birth\u201d (n=320) were 5.26, 7.42, 11.75 and 17.51, respectively. Increased HbA1c levels were also found to be associated with the\nsecondary clinical outcomes. The authors concluded that \u201cthe risk for preterm birth was strongly linked to periconceptional HbA1c levels.\nSaito, et al. (2019) examined the association of HbA1c variability (defined as visit-to-visit) and later onset of malignancies. The authors included 2640\npatients 50 years or older, with diabetes. A total of 330 patients (12.5%) developed malignancies during follow up. The authors stratified the patients\ninto quartiles of glycemic variability (defined as standard deviation of HbA1c) and found a \u201cdose-dependent association with tumorigenesis\u201d in the three\nhighest quartiles. The odds ratios were as follows: 1.20 for the second quartile, 1.43 for the third, and 2.19 for the highest. The authors concluded that\n\u201cthese results demonstrated that visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is a potential risk factor for later tumorigenesis. The association may be mediated by\noxidative stress or hormone variability.\u201d\nMa\u00f1\u00e9, et al. (2019) evaluated the \u201csuitability of first-trimester fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels in non-diabetic range to identify [individuals]\nwithout diabetes at increased pregnancy risk.\u201d Primary outcomes were defined as \u201cmacrosomia and pre-eclampsia\u201d and secondary outcomes were\ndefined as \u201cpreterm delivery, Caesarean section and large-for-gestational age.\u201d A total of 1228 pregnancies were included. Pregnant individuals with an\nHbA1c of \u22655.8% were found to have an increased risk of marcosomia (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69), an HbA1c of \u22655.9% was found to be associated with a\nthree-fold risk of pre-eclampsia, and an HbA1c of \u22656% was found to be associated with a four-fold risk of \u201clarge-for-gestational age.\u201d FPG levels were\nnot found to be associated with any pregnancy outcome.\nArbiol-Roca, et al. (2021) studied the clinical utility of HbA1c testing as a biomarker for detecting GDM and as a screening test to avoid the use of the\nOGTT. HbA1c levels were measured in 745 pregnant individuals and GDM was diagnosed in 38 patients based on HbA1c, age, and BMI. A cut off HbA1c\nvalue of 4.6% was determined to decide whether OGTT was needed or if it could be avoided. Using 4.6% HbA1c as the cut off value prevented two false\nnegatives, but only decreased the number of OGTTs performed by 7.2%. The authors conclude that \"adoption of HbA1c as a screening test for GDM may\neliminate the need of OGTT.\" Although the HbA1c test does not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as the sole diagnostic test, \"the use\nof a rule-out strategy in combination with the OGTT could be useful.\"\nHowever, the use of hemoglobin A1c testing is not useful in predicting all forms of dysglycemia. Tommerdahl, et al. (2019) evaluated several biomarkers\nfor their accuracy in screening for cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes. These biomarkers included \u201chemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 1,5-anhydroglucitol\n(1,5AG), fructosamine (FA), and glycated albumin (GA)\u201d and were compared to the current gold standard, OGTT 2-hour glucose. Fifty-eight patients with\nCF were included and \u201carea under the receiver operative characteristic (ROC-AUC) curves were generated.\u201d All ROC-AUCs for each biomarker were\n\u201clow\u201d both for cystic fibrosis-related prediabetes (CFPD, ROC-AUC 0.52-0.67) and CF-related diabetes (CFRD) (0.56-0.61). For CFRD, HbA1c was\nmeasured to have a 78% sensitivity and 41% specificity at a cutoff of 5.5%, which corresponds to a ROC-AUC of 0.61. The authors concluded that \u201cAll\nalternate markers tested demonstrate poor diagnostic accuracy for identifying CFRD by 2hG.\u201d\nIn a retrospective review of the UMass Memorial Health System electronic medical records from between 1997 and 2019, Darukhanavala, et al. (2021)\nevaluated the appropriateness of HbA1c as a screening tool for identifying patients with pre-CFRD dysglycemia to minimize the burden of annual two-\nhour OGTTs. The study included 56 patients categorized according to OGTT results (American Diabetes Association criteria): normal glucose tolerance\n(n=34), indeterminant glycemia (INDET, n=6), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, n=7), or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n=9). It was found that HbA1c\nwas positively correlated with blood glucose levels at the various time cut points (hour zero, hour one, and hour two), though the associations were\nquite weak (r = 0.248, r = 0.219, and r = 0.369, respectively). Furthermore, t-tests conducted suggested that the mean HbA1c was not significantly\ndifferent between patients with normal glucose tolerance and those in the INDET (p = 0.987), IFG (p = 0.690), and IGT (p = 0.874) groups, confirmed by\nANOVA (p = 0.250). Consequently, the authors reported that the \u201cresults do not support the use of HbA1c as a possible screening tool for pre-CFRD\ndysglycemic states, specifically INDET, IFG, and IGT.\u201d\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n5/15\nBy combining administrative datasets from the Veterans Health Administration and Medicare, Zhao, et al. (2021) evaluated the impact of hemoglobin\nA1c (A1c) variability\u2014the CV, described by A1c standard deviation divided by the average A1c value overall and expressed as a percent\u2014on the risk of\nhypoglycemia-related hospitalization (HRH) in veterans with diabetes mellitus. In this study sample of 342,059 patients, the authors identified a\n\u201cconsistent and positive relationship between A1c variability and HRH\u201d and noted that \u201cAverage A1c levels were also significantly and independently\nassociated with HRH, with levels <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) associated with lower risk and levels >9% (75 mmol/mol) conferring greater risk.\u201d Due to these\ndifferent levels of variability all remaining strong predictors of HRH risk up to three years following the baseline period, authors concluded that \u201ctracking\nA1c levels alone may be insufficient to mitigate risk.\u201d It was also acknowledged that a few limitations affected the generalizability of the study, such as\nthe lack of socioeconomic data, the study sample being predominantly white males, and including only veterans, the latter of which is a population\nwhere comorbidities are more prevalent. Consequently, these data may be reflective of \u201cthe complex interplay of disease severity, treatment, and\nsociodemographic factors,\u201d as is the case with other clinical findings.\nWhile poor outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) have been linked to diabetes, its relation to pre\u2010infection glycemic control is still unclear.\nBecause of this, Merzon, et al. (2021) investigated the association between pre\u2010infection HemoglobinA1c (A1C) levels and COVID\u201019 severity as\nassessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients (ages 14 to 103) with diabetes tested for COVID\u201019 in Leumit Health Services, Israel,\nbetween February 1 and April 30, 2020. Of the patients in this cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. A comparison of the mean HbA1c of\nthose who were COVID-19 positive (7.19%, 95% CI: 6.81%-7.57%) and the mean of those who were COVID-19 negative (6.59%, 95% CI: 6.52%-6.65%)\nwas found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). The authors expounded further by reporting the clinical characteristics of patients with diabetes\nhospitalized due to COVID-19 by demonstrating that the mean Hb1Ac levels between those hospitalized (n=46, 7.75%, 95% CI: 7.17%-8.32%) and those\nnot hospitalized (n=137, 6.83%, 95% CI: 6.54%-7.13%) were also statistically significant (p<0.005). Additionally, \u201cIn a multivariate logistic regression\nmodel adjusting for multiple potential risk factors and chronic conditions which may have a deleterious effect on disease outcomes (including age, sex,\nsmoking, IHD, SES, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, CVA, CHF, chronic lung disease, and obesity), only HbA1c \u2265 nine\npercent remained a significant predictor for hospitalization.\u201d Given the evidence, the researchers\u00a0urge \u201cPaying special attention to patients with\ndiabetes and an HbA1c \u2265 nine while allowing a more lenient approach to patients with well controlled disease,\u201d as this can reduce economic, social, and\npatient burden, especially for those who are at the greatest risk for reacting severely to COVID-19.\nXie, et al. (2021) investigated the role of FPG and glucose fluctuation on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients who already had prior diagnoses of\ndiabetes. Through a multivariate Cox analysis, the researchers found that FPG was \u201can independent prognostic factor of overall survival after\nadjustment for age, sex, diabetes, and severity of COVID-19 at admission (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25).\u201d However, blood glucose fluctuation was\nassociated with COVID-19 disease progression, as proven by the results found from the indices of the standard deviation of blood glucose and the\nlargest amplitude of glycemic excursions. Both FPG and blood glucose fluctuation indices were also found to be positively associated with increased\npresence of inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19, such as the \u201cwhite blood cell absolute count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, alkaline\nphosphatase, a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-hbdh), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase, [and] D-dimer.\u201d Ultimately, it was\nconcluded that diabetes was not an independent risk factor for in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients, as these findings were identified regardless of\ndiabetes status.\nYang, et al. (2019) aimed to find the appropriate threshold for FPG for defining prediabetes among children and adolescents. The sample was selected\nfrom school-aged children in Taiwan via a nationwide survey administered between 1992-2000, who then underwent physical examinations and blood\ntests if they exhibited abnormal urine test findings. The researchers found that the incidence of pediatric diabetes increased with increasing fasting\nplasma glucose levels, and those with FPG > 5.6mmol/L had higher adjusted hazard ratios. Additionally, \u201cthe association between fasting plasma\nglucose and incident pediatric diabetes and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were similar in boys and girls and were higher in\nthe age group twelve to eighteen years.\u201d In using 4.75 mmol/L as the optimal threshold for children six to eleven years, the sensitivity was 65% and\nspecificity was 51%. For the threshold of 5.19 mmol/L among children twelve to eighteen years, the sensitivity was 60% and the specificity was 73%.\nThis supports utilizing FPG as a supplement for diagnosing prediabetes among pediatric patients, which may contribute to better disease management.\nGeifman-Holtzman, et al. (2010) assessed the correlation between fetal macrosomia and abnormal OGTT in pregnant individuals with term gestation and\nnegative glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24 to 28 weeks. They recruited patients who had estimated fetal weights >90th percentile and a negative 50g\nGCT. From 170 individuals over a five-month period, they found that 10 patients or 5.9% had \u201cimpaired glucose metabolism at term.\u201d In this group, \u201cwe\nfound no correlation between GCT values at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks, family history of diabetes mellitus, the patient\u2019s [body mass index] or\nweight at term, and the diagnosis of impaired glucose metabolism.\u201d Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in mean fetal weight\nbetween those with normal versus abnormal OGTT. This demonstrated the lack of clinical utility of using OGTT at term for predicting the incidence of\nfetal macrosomia. The researchers suggested utilizing a larger scale study to solidify or contradict these conclusions.\nBi, et al. (2024) engaged in a cross-sectional study of participants aged >20 years old who underwent physical examination at the local hospital from\n2022 to 2023. A model was used to assess the dose-response relationship between liver enzymes and type 2 diabetes risk. Of the 14,100 participants,\nan analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between liver enzymes and\u00a0type 2 diabetes risk (P non-linear < 0.001). Specifically, type 2 diabetes risk\nincreased with rising ALT and GGT levels (range, <50 IU/L) and then leveled out when ALT and GGT levels were >50 IU/L. An elevated AST within a\ncertain range (range, <35 IU/L) decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes, but a mildly elevated AST (>35 IU/L) showed as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\nIn conclusion, liver enzymes were associated non-linearly with type 2 diabetes risk in different populations. Higher ALT and GGT levels were shown in\nthis study to increase type 2 diabetes risk as well. In conclusion, additional attention should be paid to elevated liver enzymes and diabetes, but more\nwork also needs to be done to assess association between elevation and T2D risk.\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA)\nThe ADA publishes an extensive guideline encompassing the standards of medical care in diabetes.

Grade E\u201d\nChildren & Adolescents (Ch 14)\nThe traditional idea of type 2 diabetes occurring only in adults and type 1 diabetes occurring only in children is no longer accurate, as both\ndiseases can occur in both age-groups. The recommendations concerning diabetes testing for children and adolescents are as follows:\n\u201cRisk-based screening for prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or \u226510 years of age, whichever\noccurs earlier, in youth with overweight (BMI \u226585th percentile) or obesity (BMI \u226595th percentile) and who have one or more additional risk factors\nfor diabetes.\u201d46 Grading based on risk factors;\nMaternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child's gestation-Grade A\nFamily history of type 2 diabetes in first- or second-degree relative-Grade A\nRace/ethnicity (Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American, Pacific Islander)-Grade A\nSigns of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary\nsyndrome, or small-for-gestational-age birth weight)-Grade B.\n\u201cIf tests are normal, repeat screening at a minimum of 3-year intervals [Grade E], or more frequently if BMI is increasing [Grade C].\u201d\n\u201cFasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and A1c can be used to test for prediabetes or [type 2]\ndiabetes in children and adolescents.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cChildren and adolescents with overweight or obesity in whom the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is being considered should have a panel of\npancreatic autoantibodies tested to exclude the possibility of autoimmune type 1 diabetes.\u201d Grade B\n8,46\n2\n2\n46\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n7/15\n\u201cAlthough A1c is not recommended for diagnosis of diabetes in children with cystic fibrosis or symptoms suggestive of acute onset of type 1\ndiabetes and only A1c assays without interference are appropriate for children with hemoglobinopathies, ADA continues to recommend A1c for\ndiagnosis of type 2 diabetes in this population (ungraded)\u201d\n\u201cA1C goals must be individualized and reassessed over time. An A1C of <7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate for many children\u201d Grade B.\nPregnancy (Ch 15)\n\u201c\u2026although A1c may be useful, it should be used as a secondary measure of glycemic control in pregnancy, after blood glucose monitoring.\u201d\n\u201cFasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring are recommended in individuals with diabetes in pregnancy to achieve optimal\nglucose levels. Glucose goals are fasting plasma glucose <95 mg/dL (<5.3 mmol/L) and either 1-h postprandial glucose <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L)\nor 2-h postprandial glucose <120 mg/dL (<6.7 mmol/L) Grade B\u201d\n\u201cDue to increased red blood cell turnover, A1C is slightly lower during pregnancy in people with and without diabetes. Ideally, the A1C goal in\npregnancy is <6% (<42 mmol/mol) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, but the goal may be relaxed to <7% (<53 mmol/mol) if\nnecessary to prevent hypoglycemia Grade B\u201d\n\u201cGiven the alteration in red blood cell kinetics during pregnancy and physiological changes in glycemic parameters, A1c levels may need \u201cto be\nmonitored more frequently than usual (e.g., monthly).\u201d\n\u201cThe OGTT is recommended over A1C at four to twelve weeks postpartum because A1C may be persistently impacted (lowered) by the increased\nred blood cell turnover related to pregnancy, by blood loss at delivery, or by the preceding three-month glucose profile. The OGTT is more\nsensitive at detecting glucose intolerance, including both prediabetes and diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cBecause GDM often represents previously undiagnosed prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, or even developing\ntype 1 diabetes, individuals with GDM should be tested for persistent diabetes or prediabetes at four to twelve weeks postpartum with a fasting\n75-g OGTT using nonpregnancy criteria as outlined in Section two, \u201cClassification and Diagnosis of Diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, a positive screen for diabetes requires two abnormal values. If both the fasting plasma glucose\n(\u2265126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L]) and 2-h plasma glucose (\u2265200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]) are abnormal in a single screening test, then the diagnosis of\ndiabetes is made. If only one abnormal value in the OGTT meets diabetes criteria, the test should be repeated to confirm that the abnormality\npersists.\u201d\n\u201cIndividuals with a history of GDM should have ongoing screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes every 1\u20133 years, even if the results of the\ninitial 4\u201312 week postpartum 75-g OGTT are normal. Ongoing evaluation may be performed with any recommended glycemic test (e.g., annual\nA1C, annual fasting plasma glucose, or triennial 75-g OGTT using thresholds for nonpregnant individuals).\u201d\nHeart Failure Considerations (ch. 10)\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals, routine screening for coronary artery disease is not recommended, as it does not improve outcomes as long as\nASCVD risk factors are treated.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cConsider investigations for coronary artery disease in the presence of any of the following: atypical cardiac symptoms; signs or symptoms of\nassociated vascular disease, including carotid bruits, transient ischemic attack, stroke, claudication, or PAD; or electrocardiogram abnormalities\n(e.g., Q waves).\u201d Grade E\n\u201cAdults with diabetes are at increased risk for the development of asymptomatic cardiac structural or functional abnormalities (stage B heart\nfailure) or symptomatic (stage C) heart failure. Consider screening adults with diabetes by measuring a natriuretic peptide (B-type natriuretic\npeptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-BNP [NTproBNP]) to facilitate prevention of stage C heart failure.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and abnormal natriuretic peptide levels, echocardiography is recommended to identify stage B heart\nfailure.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and age \u226550 years, microvascular disease in any location, or foot complications or any end-organ\ndamage from diabetes, screening for PAD with ankle-brachial index testing is recommended to guide treatment for cardiovascular disease\nprevention and limb preservation. A In individuals with diabetes duration \u226510 years, screening for PAD should be considered\u201d Grade B.\nNonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis & Chronic Kidney Disease (ch. 4 and ch. 11)\nFrom chapter 4:\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, particularly those with obesity or cardiometabolic risk factors or established cardiovascular disease,\nshould be screened/risk stratified for clinically significant liver fibrosis (defined as moderate fibrosis to cirrhosis) using a calculated fibrosis-4\nindex (FIB-4) (derived from age, ALT, AST, and platelets\u2026even if they have normal liver enzymes.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with diabetes or prediabetes with persistently elevated plasma aminotransferase levels for >6 months and low FIB-4 should be evaluated\nfor other causes of liver disease.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with an indeterminate or high FIB-4 should have additional risk stratification by liver stiffness\nmeasurement with transient elastography or the blood biomarker enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF).\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with indeterminate results or at high risk for significant liver fibrosis (i.e., by FIB-4, liver stiffness\nmeasurement, or ELF) should be referred to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for further workup. Interprofessional care is recommended for\nlong-term management Grade B.\u201d\nFrom chapter 11:\nAdditionally: \u201cA screening strategy based on elevated plasma aminotransferases >40 units/L would miss most individuals with NASH in these settings,\nas clinically significant fibrosis (\u2265F2) is frequently observed with plasma aminotransferases below the commonly used cutoff of 40 units/L. The American\nCollege of Gastroenterology considers the upper limit of normal ALT levels to be 29\u201333 units/L for male individuals and 19\u201325 units/L for female\nindividuals, as higher levels are associated with increased liver-related mortality, even in the absence of identifiable risk factors. The FIB-4 estimates\nthe risk of hepatic cirrhosis and is calculated from the computation of age, plasma aminotransferases (AST and ALT), and platelet count.\u201d\nIn regards to A1c and NASH, the ADA restricts its comments to the following: \u201cThe only proven primary prevention interventions for CKD in people with\ndiabetes are blood glucose (A1C goal of 7%) and blood pressure control (blood pressure <130/80 mmHg),\u201d and \u201cIntensive lowering of blood glucose with\nthe goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large, randomized studies to delay the onset and progression of albuminuria and reduce\neGFR in people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Insulin alone was used to lower blood glucose in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial\n(DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study of type 1 diabetes, while a variety of agents were used in clinical trials of type\n2 diabetes, supporting the conclusion that lowering blood glucose itself helps prevent CKD and its progression. The effects of glucose-lowering\ntherapies on CKD have helped define A1C goals.\u201d\nHospital Care Delivery Standards and Perioperative Care (ch. 16)\n49\n50\n51\n52,53\n54\n54\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n8/15\n\u201cPerform an A1C test on all people with diabetes or hyperglycemia (random blood glucose >140 mg/dL [>7.8 mmol/L]) admitted to the hospital if\nno A1C test result is available from the prior 3 months.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn hospitalized individuals with diabetes who are eating, point-of-care (POC) blood glucose monitoring should be performed before meals; in\nthose not eating, glucose monitoring is advised every 4\u20136 h. More frequent POC blood glucose monitoring ranging from every 30 min to every 2 h\nis the required standard for safe use of intravenous insulin therapy.\u201d (No grade; statement)\nThe following approach may be considered for those in preoperative and perioperative care:\n\u201cA preoperative risk assessment should be performed for people with diabetes who are at high risk for ischemic heart disease and those with\nautonomic neuropathy or renal failure.\nThe A1C goal for elective surgeries should be <8% (<63.9 mmol/L) whenever possible.\nThe blood glucose goal in the perioperative period should be 100\u2013180 mg/dL (5.6\u201310.0 mmol/L) within 4 h of the surgery. CGM should not be\nused alone for glucose monitoring during surgery.\nMetformin should be held on the day of surgery.\nSGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued 3\u20134 days before surgery.\nHold other oral glucose-lowering agents the morning of surgery or procedure and give one-half of NPH dose or 75\u201380% doses of long-acting\nanalog insulin or adjust insulin pump basal rates based on the type of diabetes and clinical judgment.\nMonitor blood glucose at least every 2\u20134 h while the individual takes nothing by mouth and dose with short- or rapid-acting insulin as needed.\nThere is little data on the safe use and/or influence of GLP-1 receptor agonists on glycemia and delayed gastric emptying in the perioperative\nperiod.\nStricter perioperative glycemic goals are not advised, as perioperative glycemic goals stricter than 80\u2013180 mg/dL (4.4\u201310.0 mmol/L) may not\nimprove outcomes and are associated with more hypoglycemia.\nCompared with usual dosing, a reduction by 25% of basal insulin given the evening before surgery is more likely to achieve perioperative blood\nglucose goals with a lower risk for hypoglycemia.\nIn individuals undergoing noncardiac general surgery, basal insulin plus premeal short- or rapid-acting insulin (basal-bolus) coverage has been\nassociated with improved glycemic outcomes and lower rates of perioperative complications compared with the reactive, correction-only short- or\nrapid-acting insulin coverage alone with no basal insulin dosing.\u201d\nThe ADA did not specifically mention \u201cbariatric surgery\u201d in their hospital care delivery section (ch. 16).\nDiabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee\nThis Expert Committee published a comprehensive guideline on the prevention and management of diabetes. Relevant items, recommendations, and\ncomments\u2014particularly those relating to the use of A1c testing\u2014are captured below:\n\u201cScreen for type 2 diabetes using a fasting plasma glucose and/or glycated hemoglobin (A1C) every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or\nin individuals at high risk on a risk calculator (33% chance of developing diabetes over ten years).\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of evidence for interventions to prevent or delay type 1 diabetes, routine screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended.\u201d\n\u201cFor most individuals with diabetes, A1C should be measured approximately every three months to ensure that glycemic goals are being met or\nmaintained. In some circumstances, such as when significant changes are made to therapy, or during pregnancy, it is appropriate to check A1C\nmore frequently. Testing at least every six months should be performed in adults during periods of treatment and healthy behavior stability when\nglycemic targets have been consistently achieved.\u201d\nA1C can be misleading in various medical conditions (\u201ce.g., hemoglobinopathies, iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia, severe hepatic or renal\ndisease\u201d) and should not be used for \u201cdiagnostic use in children and adolescents (as the sole diagnostic test), pregnant [individuals] as part of\nroutine screening for gestational diabetes, those with cystic fibrosis or those with suspected type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nDiabetes \u201cshould\u201d be diagnosed at a level of A1C \u22656.5%.\n\u201cScreening for diabetes using FPG and/or A1C should be performed every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or at high risk using a risk\ncalculator [Grade D, Consensus]. Earlier testing and/or more frequent follow up (every six to twelve months) with either FPG and/or A1C should\nbe considered in those at very high risk using a risk calculator or in people with additional risk factors for diabetes [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d\nIt should be mentioned that \u201cGlycemic targets should be individualized [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d based upon various considerations including, but not\nlimited to, the patient\u2019s functional dependence, medical history, life expectancy, and life course stage. Moreover, the grading of recommendations above\n(e.g., \u201cGrade D\u201d) reflect the methodological rigor used at arriving at the conclusion, such that lower grades reflect the presence of weaker evidence. But\nthough the \u201cpaucity of clinical evidence addressing the areas of therapy, prevention, diagnosis or prognosis precluded the assignment of a higher\ngrade,\u201d the authors recognize and note that many Grade D recommendations are \u201cvery important to the contemporary management of diabetes.\u201d\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)\nThe USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who are overweight or obese, and such\n\u201cScreening tests for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes include measurement of fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c level or an oral glucose tolerance test.\u201d\nRecognizing that \u201cThe optimal screening interval for adults with an initial normal glucose test result is uncertain,\u201d the USPSTF suggests that \u201cScreening\nevery three years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels.\u201d\nThe USPSTF has also provided guidelines pertaining to the screening of gestational diabetes. For asymptomatic pregnant persons at 24 weeks\ngestation or after, with a letter \u201cB\u201d grade, the USPSTF recommends screening for gestational diabetes in this population. However, in asymptomatic\npregnant persons before 24 weeks gestation, the USPSTF states that \u201ccurrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of\nscreening\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nAn \u201cI\u201d grade is defined by the USPSTF as \u201cI Statement- The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits\nand harms cannot be determined.\u201d\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n9/15\nIn 2022, the USPSTF released its first recommendation on screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. This recommendation applies to\nchildren and adolescents who are not pregnant and who are younger than 18 years of age without known diabetes or prediabetes and who are without\nsymptoms of diabetes or prediabetes. The USPSTF states that the goal of screening for type 2 diabetes in young people is \u201cto diagnose and treat it\nearly to prevent development of bad health outcomes. However, no studies have looked at the link between screening for type 2 diabetes in children and\nadolescents and bad health outcomes. Studies about the effect of type 2 diabetes treatment on health outcomes in children and adolescents have not\nhad enough patients with bad outcomes to draw any meaningful conclusions. No studies have looked at harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in young\npeople. Potential harms may include side effects from medications used to treat diabetes, such as low blood glucose, nausea, or vomiting.\u201d Based on\nthe current evidence for asymptomatic children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age, the USPSTF concluded that \u201ccurrent evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)\nThe Global Report on Diabetes states that: \u201cGlycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the method of choice for monitoring glycaemic control in diabetes. An\nadvantage of using HbA1c is that the patient does not need to be in a fasting state. Ideally it should be measured twice a year in people\u00a0with type 2\ndiabetes and more frequently in those with type 1 diabetes. However, HbA1c testing is more costly than glucose measurement, and therefore less\nreadily available. If HbA1c testing is not available, fasting, or post-meal blood glucose is an acceptable substitute.\u201d\nThe WHO also published a \u201cmodule\u201d titled \u201cHearts-D: Diagnosis and Management of Type 2 Diabetes in 2020. In it, a testing algorithm for \u201ctreatment of\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin\u201d is included at the bottom. The algorithm calls for an HbA1c assessment to be performed \u201cin three months\u201d if the\npatient is stabilized as a result of the insulin treatment.\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)\nIn 2022, the AAFP published a clinical summary of the USPSTF recommendation for screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The\ndocument deferred to the USPSTF recommendations, with the testing audience being \u201cNonpregnant adults aged thirty-five to seventy years who have\noverweight or obesity and no symptoms of diabetes\u201d\u2014a move from 40 years of age in the previous recommendation\u2014while deeming screening every\nthree years to be a reasonable approach.\nEndocrine Society\nThe Endocrine Society published this guideline regarding management of diabetes in older adults. In it, they recommend screening for prediabetes or\ndiabetes every two years for patients 65 years or older. FPG and/or HbA1c may be used. However, the Society does recommend caution when\ninterpreting HbA1c results, as older patients are more likely to have conditions that alter red blood cell turnover.\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\nNICE published an update to their guideline on diabetes management. In it, they make the following recommendations:\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c levels in adults with type 2 diabetes every:\nThree to six months (tailored to individual needs) until HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy.\nSix months once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable.\u201d\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c using methods calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardization.\u201d\n\u201cIf HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type, estimate trends in blood glucose control using\none of the following:\nquality-controlled plasma glucose profiles\ntotal glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)\nfructosamine estimation.\u201d\n\u201cInvestigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes\nor clinical biochemistry.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)\nThe AACE provides the following inclusion criteria for individuals who should be screened for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes:\nAge \u226545 years without other risk factors\nCVD or family history of T2D\nOverweight or obese\nSedentary lifestyle\nMember of an at-risk racial or ethnic group:\nAsian\nAfrican American\nHispanic\nNative American (Alaska Natives and American Indians)\nPacific Islander\nHigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level >250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L)\nImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and/or metabolic syndrome\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), acanthosis nigricans, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\nHypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg or on antihypertensive therapy)\nHistory of gestational diabetes or delivery of a baby weighing more than 5 kg (9 lb)\nAntipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia and/or severe bipolar disease\nChronic glucocorticoid exposure\nSleep disorders in the presence of glucose intolerance (A1C >5.7%, IGT, or IFG on previous testing), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),\nchronic sleep deprivation, and night-shift occupation\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n10/15\nThe AACE recommends repeat testing at least every three years for individuals with normal results. Consider annual screening for patients with two or\nmore risk factors.\nIn a 2022 update focusing on developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan, the AACE expounds on how the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus\nshould be made. According to the authors, the ELs refer to evidence levels established by AACE evidence ratings, where \u201cdescriptors of \u201cmust,\u201d\n\u201cshould,\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d generally but not strictly correlate with Grade A (strong), Grade B (intermediate), and Grade C (weak) recommendations,\nrespectively.\u201d\nThe relevant recommendations are captured below.\n\u201cRecommendation 1.1\nThe diagnosis of DM is based on the following criteria\u2026:\nFPG concentration \u2265126 mg/dL (after \u2265 eight hours of an overnight fast), or\nPlasma glucose (PG) concentration \u2265200 mg/dL two hours after ingesting a 75-g oral glucose load after an overnight fast of at least eight hours,\nor\nSymptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia) and a random (nonfasting) PG concentration \u2265200 mg/dL, or\nA1C level \u22656.5%\nDiagnosis of DM requires two abnormal test results, either from the same sample or two abnormal results on samples drawn on different days. However,\na glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms for DM confirms the diagnosis of DM.\nGrade A; BEL 2 and expert opinion of task force\nRecommendation 1.2\nPrediabetes is identified by the presence of IFG (100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), which is a PG value of 140 to 199 mg/dL two\nhours after ingesting 75 g of glucose, and/or A1C value between 5.7% and 6.4% (Table 4). A1C should be used only for screening for prediabetes. The\ndiagnosis of prediabetes, which may manifest as either IFG or IGT, should be confirmed with glucose testing.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.3\nT1D is characterized by marked insulin deficiency in the presence of hyperglycemia and positive autoantibody tests to glutamic acid decarboxylase\n(GAD65), pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells (tyrosine phosphatase IA-2), and IA-2b zinc transporter (ZnT8), and/or insulin. The presence of immune markers and\nclinical presentation are needed to establish the correct diagnosis and to distinguish between T1D and T2D in children or adults, as well as to determine\nappropriate treatment.\nGrade A; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.4\nT2D is characterized by progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion and variable defects in insulin sensitivity. T2D is often asymptomatic and can remain\nundiagnosed for many years; therefore, all adults \u226535 years of age with risk factors should be screened for DM (Table 5).\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.5\nGDM is defined as carbohydrate intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy and resolves postpartum. Pregnant individuals with risk\nfactors for DM should be screened at the first prenatal visit for undiagnosed T2D using standard criteria (Table 4).\nGrade B; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.6\nScreen all pregnant individuals for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Diagnose GDM with either the one-step or the two-step\napproach.\nThe one-step approach uses a two-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after \u2265 eight hours of fasting with diagnostic cutoffs of one or\nmore FPG \u226592 mg/dL, one-hour PG \u2265180 mg/dL, or two-hour PG \u2265153 mg/dL.\nThe two-step approach uses a nonfasting one-hour 50-g glucose challenge test with one-hour PG screening threshold of 130 or 140 mg/dL. For\nindividuals with a positive screening test, the three-hour 100-g OGTT is used for diagnosis with two or more PG tests that meet the following\nthresholds: FPG \u226595 mg/dL, 1-hour \u2265180 mg/dL, 2-hour \u2265155 mg/dL, 3-hour \u2265140 mg/dL.\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.7\nClinicians should consider evaluation for monogenic DM in any child or young adult with an atypical presentation, clinical course, or response to\ntherapy. Monogenic DM includes neonatal diabetes and nonautoimmune diabetes of multiple genetic causes, also known as maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young (MODY). Most children with DM occurring under six months of age have a monogenic cause as autoimmune T1D rarely occurs before six\nmonths of age. Other monogenic forms of diabetes are characterized by mutation of genes of transcription factors, genes regulating pancreatic\ndevelopment or atrophy, abnormal insulin genes, genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress that impair insulin secretion, or abnormal glucokinase\ngenes that cause impaired insulin signaling.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nAlthough not expressly listed as recommendations for diabetes screening, some additional information of note includes the following:\n\u201cA glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of hyperglycemia symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia confirm the diagnosis of DM. In\nindividuals with discordant results from two different tests, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated on a different\nday.\u201d\n\u201cIn view of physiological changes in pregnancy that could affect glycated hemoglobin levels, A1C should not be used for GDM screening or\ndiagnosis of DM.\u201d\n66\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n11/15\n\u201cAll pregnant individuals should be screened for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Universal screening is recommended, as\nselective screening (only in individuals with risk factors) would miss a significant number of individuals with GDM and universal screening has\nbeen shown to be cost-effective compared with selective screening.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE)\nThe 2020 Consensus Statement from the AACE/ACE on the Management of Type 2 Diabetes states:\n\"The hemoglobin A1c (A1c) target should be individualized based on numerous factors such as age, life expectancy, comorbid conditions,\nduration of diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia or adverse consequences from hypoglycemia, patient motivation, and adherence.\"\n\u201cAn A1c level of \u22646.5% is considered optimal if it can be achieved in a safe and affordable manner, but higher targets may be appropriate for\ncertain individuals and may change for a given individual over time.\u201d\n\u201cTherapy must be evaluated frequently (e.g., every three months) until stable using multiple criteria, including A1c, SMBG records (fasting and\npostprandial) or continuous glucose monitoring tracings, documented and suspected hypoglycemia events, lipid and BP values, adverse events\n(weight gain, fluid retention, hepatic or renal impairment, or CVD), comorbidities, other relevant laboratory data, concomitant drug administration,\ncomplications of diabetes, and psychosocial factors affecting patient care. Less frequent monitoring is acceptable once targets are achieved.\u201d\nIn 2023, the AACE/ACE released \u201cGuidelines and Recommendations for Laboratory Analysis in the Diagnosis and Management of Diabetes Mellitus.\u201d\nDiagnosis related recommendations:\n\u201cFasting glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used to establish the diagnosis of diabetes, with a value \u22657.0 mmol/L (\u2265126 mg/dL)\ndiagnostic of diabetes. A (high)\u201d\nScreening related recommendations:\n\u201cRecommendation: Screening by HbA1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT is recommended for individuals who are at high risk of diabetes. If HbA1c is <5.7%\n(<39 mmol/mol), FPG is <5.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL), and/or 2-h plasma glucose is <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year\nintervals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used for screening of high-risk individuals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Plasma glucose should be measured in an accredited laboratory when used for diagnosis of or screening for diabetes. GPP\n(good practice point)\u201d\nMonitoring/Prognosis:\n\u201cRecommendation: Routine measurement of plasma glucose concentrations in a laboratory is not recommended as the primary means of\nmonitoring or evaluating therapy in individuals with diabetes. B (moderate)\u201d\nKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Diabetes Working Group\nThe KDIGO group published recommendations on diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). They recommend using HbA1c to monitor diabetic and\nCKD patients twice a year or as often as four times a year if glycemic target is not met or a change is made in therapy. KDIGO advises that \"accuracy\nand precision of HbA1c measurement declines with advanced CKD, particularly among patients treated by dialysis, in whom HbA1c measurements have\nlow reliability.\" They also recommend an \"individualized HbA1c target ranging from <6.5% to <8.0% in patients with diabetes and CKD not treated with\ndialysis.\u201d\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a condition where there is a buildup of fat in the liver. It is seen in individuals who\ndrink little to no alcohol but who have\u00a0diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. Diabetes is both a possible cause of and or symptom\nof MASLD: while diabetes is a risk factor for developing MASLD, individuals who have been diagnosed with MASLD may be at risk for developing heart\ndisease and diabetes.",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\nPrevalence: In 2021, 38.4 million Americans, or 11.6% of the population, had diabetes. Approximately 1.9 million American children and adults\nhave type 1 diabetes, including about 244,000 children and adolescents.\nDiagnosed and undiagnosed: Of the 38.4 million, 29.7 million were diagnosed, and 8.7 million were undiagnosed.\nPrevalence in seniors: The percentage of Americans aged 65 and older remains high, at 29.2%, or 15.9 million seniors (diagnosed and\nundiagnosed).\nNew cases: 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year.\nPrediabetes: In 2021, 97.6 million Americans aged eighteen and older had prediabetes.\nDeaths: Diabetes remains the 8th leading cause of death in the United States in 2021, with 103,294 death certificates listing it as the underlying\ncause of death, and a total of 399.401 death certificates listing diabetes as a cause of death.\nTotal economic cost of diabetes care in the United States: $413 billion in 2022.\nDiabetes can be classified into the following categories:\n\u201cType 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune \u03b2-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency)\u201d\n\u201cType 2 diabetes (due to a progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background of insulin resistance)\u201d\n\u201cGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior\nto gestation)\u201d\n\u201cSpecific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young [MODY]), diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as\nwith glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, or after organ transplantation)\u201d  The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is easily established\nwhen a patient presents with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, which include polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, blurred vision, and, infrequently,\nweight loss. The frequency of symptomatic diabetes has been decreasing in parallel with improved efforts to diagnose diabetes earlier through\nscreening. Increasingly, the majority of patients are asymptomatic, and hyperglycemia is noted on routine laboratory evaluation, prompting further\ntesting.\n6,7\n8\n3\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n3/15\nGlycated hemoglobin A1c (also known as HbA1c, A1c, glycohemoglobin, or hemoglobin A1c) testing plays a key role in the management of diabetes.\nNew hemoglobin enters circulation with minimal glucose attached. However, glucose irreversibly binds to hemoglobin based on the surrounding blood\nglucose concentration. Therefore, A1c is considered a measure of blood glucose level, albeit an indirect one. It is best correlated with the mean glucose\nlevel over the last eight to twelve weeks as red blood cells experience significant turnover. Various factors may affect the reliability of A1c (atypical\nhemoglobins or hemoglobinopathies, chronic kidney disease, et al.), but most assays have been standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications\nTrial (DCCT) standard, which \u201cestimated the mean blood glucose concentrations derived from seven measurements a day (before and ninety minutes\nafter each of the three major\u00a0meals, and before bedtime), performed once every three months and compared the average glucose concentration with\nA1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nThe HbA1c assay provides information about the degree of long-term glucose control,  and has been recommended for the diagnosis and monitoring of\ndiabetes.\nVarious methods of HbA1c measurement include chromatography based HPLC assay, boronate affinity, antibody-based immunoassay, and\nenzyme based enzymatic assay.\nLong-term blood sugar control has been associated with decreased risk of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and\ncardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial, cerebrovascular disease,\nand myocardial fibrosis in adults with diabetes.\nHigher HbA1c variability has\nbeen associated with higher all-cause mortality in patients with Type 2 Diabetes.\nFasting plasma glucose is a method of glucose monitoring that measures an individual\u2019s glucose level typically in a period defined with no caloric intake\nfor eight hours or more. Its usage in the diagnosis of diabetes lies primarily in gestational diabetes, along with the OGTT, but HbA1c, FPG, or OGTTs\nwith their respective positive results can be used in diagnosing diabetes mellitus in nonpregnant individuals as well. To diagnose diabetes in\nasymptomatic individuals, a FPG has to be \u2265 126 mg/dL. For diagnosing prediabetes, an individual may have \u201cimpaired fasting glucose,\u201d which would\npresent with a range of 100-125 mg/Dl.\nTraditionally, the diagnosis of diabetes was predicated on plasma glucose levels as well as symptom presentation. In 2010, the ADA endorsed as a\n\u201creliable retrospective marker of blood glucose control over the past 6-8 weeks.\u201d The advantages of HbA1c testing include increased convenience,\nincreased stability and decreased variation in measurement. While the ADA 2023 guidelines gave precedence to FPG, the latest 2024 guideline\naddressed the vital importance of HbA1c for both diagnostic and screening purposes (for both diabetes and prediabetes care).\nThe ADA notes that there are areas where HbA1c is insufficient and plasma glucose levels are the preferred measurement: \u201cIn the presence of\nhemoglobin variants, pregnancy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and other conditions that might potentially interfere with accurate\nHbA1c measurements, plasma glucose levels are preferred. Furthermore, in situations where elevated blood glucose levels might not be consistently\napparent, the diagnosis of diabetes necessitates two abnormal test results (HbA1c and plasma glucose) either simultaneously or at different time points.\nIn such scenarios, alternative biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin emerge as viable options for monitoring glycemic status.\nFructosamine reflects the total pool of glycated serum proteins, mainly albumin, reflecting glycemic trends over a span of two to four weeks\u2014a relatively\nshorter duration compared to A1C. Although these biomarkers show a strong correlation and are associated with long-term complications based on\nepidemiological evidence, the empirical support for their application is not as robust as that for HbA1c.\u201d\nThe OGTT can be more inconvenient and used in the setting to diagnose GDM. Normally, 75g of glucose is ingested by the patient, and if the patient\nhas a two-hour plasma glucose value of \u2265200 mg/dL, a diagnosis of diabetes can be made. The test can also be performed at one-hour with 50g oral\nglucose, with positive GDM diagnostic results between 130-140 mg/dL as part of a two-step approach with the three-hour 100g test, which can be\ndiagnostic of GDM with two elevated values. For prediabetes with an accompanied \u201cimpaired glucose tolerance,\u201d a two-hour plasma glucose value\nbetween 140-199 mg/dL is used. However, the WHO requires an additional FPG <126 in addition to the two-hour plasma glucose value to establish\nimpaired glucose tolerance.\nAnalytical Validity\nThe International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Working Group on HbA1c Standardization has developed a reference\nmeasurement system and the measurement of HbA1c is currently well-standardized,\nand a sound reference system is in place to ensure continuity and\nstability of the analytical validity of HbA1c measurement.\nIn contrast, plasma glucose concentration remains difficult to assay with consistent\naccuracy.\nHbA1c has greater analytical stability (consistency with repetitive sample testing) and less day-to-day variability than either the fasting\nplasma glucose (FPG)or two-hour PG.\nFor any given individual, the HbA1c exhibits little short-term biologic variability; its coefficient of variation\n(CV) is 3.6%, compared to FPG (CV of 5.7%) and 2-h PG (CV of 16.6%).\nA sample proficiency testing survey performed by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and College of American Pathologists\n(CAP) evaluated the accuracy of A1c assays. The survey found that \u201cmethod-specific, between-laboratory CV\u2019s ranged from 0.7% to 4.0%\u201d and\n\u201capproximately 85% of laboratories are using methods with CVs <3% at all five HbA1c levels.\u201d The survey also noted the current pass limit was \u00b16%, but\nusing a pass rate of 97.1% to 98.0% of labs passed.\nClinical Utility and Validity\nTesting A1c, FPG, and 2-h PG measure different aspects of glycemia and are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1c \u22656.5% identifies fewer\nindividuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria; however, a recent study concluded that twelve percent of patients can be misclassified with\nrespect to diabetes diagnosis due to laboratory instrument error in measuring glucose.\nThe New Hoorn Study analyzed the diagnostic properties of the\nA1c, using OGTT as the diagnostic criterion.\nThe analysis suggested that an A1c of 5.8% had a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 91%. This\ncompares with specificity of 24% and sensitivity of 99% for the A1c cut point of 6.5%. On the other hand, the 6.5% cut point had a positive predictive\nvalue of 93%, compared with a positive predictive value of only 24% for a cut point of 5.8%.\nWhen using the reference diagnosis of diabetes being a two-hour blood glucose >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT, the specificity of FPG \u2265126\nmg/dL was >95% and sensitivity about 50%, with possibly lower sensitivities and specificities for individuals over 65 years.27 With the same OGTT\nreference, the specificity and sensitivity of an A1c \u22656.5%, as per diagnosis of diabetes, were reported as 79% and 44%, respectively.\nCowie, et al. (2010) \u201cexamined prevalence\u2019s of previously diagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes and high risk for diabetes using recently\nsuggested A1c criteria in the U.S. during 2003\u20132006. We compared these prevalence\u2019s to those in earlier surveys and those using glucose criteria.\u201d\n14,611 individuals were included (completed a household interview) and classified for diagnosed diabetes and by A1c, fasting, and 2-h glucose\nchallenge values. Diagnostic values for A1c were \u22656.5% for \u201cundiagnosed\u201d diabetes and 6%-6.5% for \u201chigh risk\u201d of diabetes. The authors found that by\nthese A1c diagnostic values, the \u201ccrude prevalence\u201d of diabetes in adults older than twenty years was 20.4 million, of which nineteen percent went\nundiagnosed based on A1c \u2265 6.5%. The authors then stated that the A1c criteria only diagnosed thirty percent of the undiagnosed diabetic group.\n5\n9\n8,10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n3,4\n15\n4,16\n17\n18\n19\n20,21\n22,23\n24\n25\n26\n22\n28\n29\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n4/15\nMamtora, et al. (2021) assessed the clinical utility of point-of-care (POC) HbA1c testing in the ophthalmology outpatient setting. Forty-nine patients with\ndiabetic retinopathy underwent POC HbA1c testing and blood pressure measurement. Of the 49 patients, 81.6% had POC readings above the\nrecommended HbA1c levels and only 16.3% of these patients were aware of their elevated HbA1c levels. Fourteen patients (33.3%) with high HbA1c\nreadings were referred to secondary diabetic services and 88.8% of patients felt like the test was useful. The authors suggest that POC HbA1c testing is\na \"cost-effective, reproducible and clinically significant tool for the management of diabetes in an outpatient ophthalmology setting, allowing the rapid\nrecognition of high-risk patients and appropriate referral to secondary diabetic services.\"\nGoodney, et al. (2016) evaluated the consistency of A1c testing of diabetes patients and its effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The study included\n1574415 Medicare patients with diabetes mellitus, and the consistency of testing was separated into three categories: \u201clow (testing in zero or one of\nthree years), medium (testing in two of three years), and high (testing in all three years).\u201d Approximately 70.2% of patients received high-consistency\ntesting, 17.6% received medium-consistency, and 12.2% received low-consistency. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) included \u201cdeath,\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, amputation, or the need for leg revascularization.\u201d Low-consistency patients was associated with death or other adverse\nevents (hazard ratio: 1.21). The authors concluded that \u201cconsistent annual hemoglobin A1c testing is associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular\noutcomes in this observational cohort of Medicare patients of diabetes mellitus.\u201d\nThe GOAL study used A1c to assess diabetes control in a real-world practice study aimed to assess predictive factors for achieving the glycemic\nhemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at six months as targeted by the treating physician in adults with type 2 diabetes. In this study, 2704 patients with a mean A1c\nof 9.7% were enrolled. After six months, lower baseline A1c (\u2265 8.5% vs <7%) was found to be a predictive factor for achieving glycemic control. The\nauthors also observed \u201cabsolute changes in the mean HbA1c of \u22121.7% and \u22122% were observed from baseline to six and twelve months, respectively.\u201d\nMitsios, et al. (2018) evaluated the association between A1c and stroke risk. Twenty-nine studies (n=532779) were included. The authors compared the\nnon-diabetic A1c range (<5.7%) to the diabetic range (\u22656.5%) and found that the diabetic range was associated with a 2.15-fold increased risk of first-\never stroke. The prediabetes range of 5.7%-6.5% was also not associated with first-ever stroke. The authors also observed that for every one percent\nincrease in A1c, the hazard ratio of first-ever stroke increased (1.12-fold for non-diabetic ranges, 1.17 for diabetic ones). This increased risk was also\nseen for ischemic stroke, with a hazard ratio of 1.49 for non-diabetic ranges and 1.24 for diabetic ranges.\nLudvigsson, et al. (2019) evaluated the association between preterm birth risk and periconceptional HbA1c levels in pregnant individuals with type 1\ndiabetes (T1D). Preterm birth was defined as <37 weeks and several secondary outcomes were also examined, which were \u201cneonatal death, large-for-\ngestational age, macrosomia, infant birth injury, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, five-minute Apgar score less than seven, and stillbirth.\u201d A total of\n2474 singletons born to individuals with T1D and 1165216 reference infants (children born to mothers without T1D) were included. The authors identified\n552 preterm births in the T1D cohort (22.3%) compared to 54287 in the control cohort (4.7%). Incidences of preterm birth were measured at several\nseparate thresholds, including <6.5%, 6.5%-7.8%, 7.8%-9.1%, and >9.1%. The T1D cohort\u2019s adjusted risk ratios (aRR) of preterm birth compared to the\ncontrol cohort were as\u00a0follows: 2.83 for <6.5%, 4.22 for 6.5%-7.8%, 5.56 for 7.8%-9.1%, and 6.91 for >9.1%. The corresponding aRRs for \u201cmedically\nindicated preterm birth\u201d (n=320) were 5.26, 7.42, 11.75 and 17.51, respectively. Increased HbA1c levels were also found to be associated with the\nsecondary clinical outcomes. The authors concluded that \u201cthe risk for preterm birth was strongly linked to periconceptional HbA1c levels.\nSaito, et al. (2019) examined the association of HbA1c variability (defined as visit-to-visit) and later onset of malignancies. The authors included 2640\npatients 50 years or older, with diabetes. A total of 330 patients (12.5%) developed malignancies during follow up. The authors stratified the patients\ninto quartiles of glycemic variability (defined as standard deviation of HbA1c) and found a \u201cdose-dependent association with tumorigenesis\u201d in the three\nhighest quartiles. The odds ratios were as follows: 1.20 for the second quartile, 1.43 for the third, and 2.19 for the highest. The authors concluded that\n\u201cthese results demonstrated that visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is a potential risk factor for later tumorigenesis. The association may be mediated by\noxidative stress or hormone variability.\u201d\nMa\u00f1\u00e9, et al. (2019) evaluated the \u201csuitability of first-trimester fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels in non-diabetic range to identify [individuals]\nwithout diabetes at increased pregnancy risk.\u201d Primary outcomes were defined as \u201cmacrosomia and pre-eclampsia\u201d and secondary outcomes were\ndefined as \u201cpreterm delivery, Caesarean section and large-for-gestational age.\u201d A total of 1228 pregnancies were included. Pregnant individuals with an\nHbA1c of \u22655.8% were found to have an increased risk of marcosomia (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69), an HbA1c of \u22655.9% was found to be associated with a\nthree-fold risk of pre-eclampsia, and an HbA1c of \u22656% was found to be associated with a four-fold risk of \u201clarge-for-gestational age.\u201d FPG levels were\nnot found to be associated with any pregnancy outcome.\nArbiol-Roca, et al. (2021) studied the clinical utility of HbA1c testing as a biomarker for detecting GDM and as a screening test to avoid the use of the\nOGTT. HbA1c levels were measured in 745 pregnant individuals and GDM was diagnosed in 38 patients based on HbA1c, age, and BMI. A cut off HbA1c\nvalue of 4.6% was determined to decide whether OGTT was needed or if it could be avoided. Using 4.6% HbA1c as the cut off value prevented two false\nnegatives, but only decreased the number of OGTTs performed by 7.2%. The authors conclude that \"adoption of HbA1c as a screening test for GDM may\neliminate the need of OGTT.\" Although the HbA1c test does not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as the sole diagnostic test, \"the use\nof a rule-out strategy in combination with the OGTT could be useful.\"\nHowever, the use of hemoglobin A1c testing is not useful in predicting all forms of dysglycemia. Tommerdahl, et al. (2019) evaluated several biomarkers\nfor their accuracy in screening for cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes. These biomarkers included \u201chemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 1,5-anhydroglucitol\n(1,5AG), fructosamine (FA), and glycated albumin (GA)\u201d and were compared to the current gold standard, OGTT 2-hour glucose. Fifty-eight patients with\nCF were included and \u201carea under the receiver operative characteristic (ROC-AUC) curves were generated.\u201d All ROC-AUCs for each biomarker were\n\u201clow\u201d both for cystic fibrosis-related prediabetes (CFPD, ROC-AUC 0.52-0.67) and CF-related diabetes (CFRD) (0.56-0.61). For CFRD, HbA1c was\nmeasured to have a 78% sensitivity and 41% specificity at a cutoff of 5.5%, which corresponds to a ROC-AUC of 0.61. The authors concluded that \u201cAll\nalternate markers tested demonstrate poor diagnostic accuracy for identifying CFRD by 2hG.\u201d\nIn a retrospective review of the UMass Memorial Health System electronic medical records from between 1997 and 2019, Darukhanavala, et al. (2021)\nevaluated the appropriateness of HbA1c as a screening tool for identifying patients with pre-CFRD dysglycemia to minimize the burden of annual two-\nhour OGTTs. The study included 56 patients categorized according to OGTT results (American Diabetes Association criteria): normal glucose tolerance\n(n=34), indeterminant glycemia (INDET, n=6), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, n=7), or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n=9). It was found that HbA1c\nwas positively correlated with blood glucose levels at the various time cut points (hour zero, hour one, and hour two), though the associations were\nquite weak (r = 0.248, r = 0.219, and r = 0.369, respectively). Furthermore, t-tests conducted suggested that the mean HbA1c was not significantly\ndifferent between patients with normal glucose tolerance and those in the INDET (p = 0.987), IFG (p = 0.690), and IGT (p = 0.874) groups, confirmed by\nANOVA (p = 0.250). Consequently, the authors reported that the \u201cresults do not support the use of HbA1c as a possible screening tool for pre-CFRD\ndysglycemic states, specifically INDET, IFG, and IGT.\u201d\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n5/15\nBy combining administrative datasets from the Veterans Health Administration and Medicare, Zhao, et al. (2021) evaluated the impact of hemoglobin\nA1c (A1c) variability\u2014the CV, described by A1c standard deviation divided by the average A1c value overall and expressed as a percent\u2014on the risk of\nhypoglycemia-related hospitalization (HRH) in veterans with diabetes mellitus. In this study sample of 342,059 patients, the authors identified a\n\u201cconsistent and positive relationship between A1c variability and HRH\u201d and noted that \u201cAverage A1c levels were also significantly and independently\nassociated with HRH, with levels <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) associated with lower risk and levels >9% (75 mmol/mol) conferring greater risk.\u201d Due to these\ndifferent levels of variability all remaining strong predictors of HRH risk up to three years following the baseline period, authors concluded that \u201ctracking\nA1c levels alone may be insufficient to mitigate risk.\u201d It was also acknowledged that a few limitations affected the generalizability of the study, such as\nthe lack of socioeconomic data, the study sample being predominantly white males, and including only veterans, the latter of which is a population\nwhere comorbidities are more prevalent. Consequently, these data may be reflective of \u201cthe complex interplay of disease severity, treatment, and\nsociodemographic factors,\u201d as is the case with other clinical findings.\nWhile poor outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) have been linked to diabetes, its relation to pre\u2010infection glycemic control is still unclear.\nBecause of this, Merzon, et al. (2021) investigated the association between pre\u2010infection HemoglobinA1c (A1C) levels and COVID\u201019 severity as\nassessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients (ages 14 to 103) with diabetes tested for COVID\u201019 in Leumit Health Services, Israel,\nbetween February 1 and April 30, 2020. Of the patients in this cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. A comparison of the mean HbA1c of\nthose who were COVID-19 positive (7.19%, 95% CI: 6.81%-7.57%) and the mean of those who were COVID-19 negative (6.59%, 95% CI: 6.52%-6.65%)\nwas found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). The authors expounded further by reporting the clinical characteristics of patients with diabetes\nhospitalized due to COVID-19 by demonstrating that the mean Hb1Ac levels between those hospitalized (n=46, 7.75%, 95% CI: 7.17%-8.32%) and those\nnot hospitalized (n=137, 6.83%, 95% CI: 6.54%-7.13%) were also statistically significant (p<0.005). Additionally, \u201cIn a multivariate logistic regression\nmodel adjusting for multiple potential risk factors and chronic conditions which may have a deleterious effect on disease outcomes (including age, sex,\nsmoking, IHD, SES, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, CVA, CHF, chronic lung disease, and obesity), only HbA1c \u2265 nine\npercent remained a significant predictor for hospitalization.\u201d Given the evidence, the researchers\u00a0urge \u201cPaying special attention to patients with\ndiabetes and an HbA1c \u2265 nine while allowing a more lenient approach to patients with well controlled disease,\u201d as this can reduce economic, social, and\npatient burden, especially for those who are at the greatest risk for reacting severely to COVID-19.\nXie, et al. (2021) investigated the role of FPG and glucose fluctuation on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients who already had prior diagnoses of\ndiabetes. Through a multivariate Cox analysis, the researchers found that FPG was \u201can independent prognostic factor of overall survival after\nadjustment for age, sex, diabetes, and severity of COVID-19 at admission (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25).\u201d However, blood glucose fluctuation was\nassociated with COVID-19 disease progression, as proven by the results found from the indices of the standard deviation of blood glucose and the\nlargest amplitude of glycemic excursions. Both FPG and blood glucose fluctuation indices were also found to be positively associated with increased\npresence of inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19, such as the \u201cwhite blood cell absolute count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, alkaline\nphosphatase, a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-hbdh), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase, [and] D-dimer.\u201d Ultimately, it was\nconcluded that diabetes was not an independent risk factor for in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients, as these findings were identified regardless of\ndiabetes status.\nYang, et al. (2019) aimed to find the appropriate threshold for FPG for defining prediabetes among children and adolescents. The sample was selected\nfrom school-aged children in Taiwan via a nationwide survey administered between 1992-2000, who then underwent physical examinations and blood\ntests if they exhibited abnormal urine test findings. The researchers found that the incidence of pediatric diabetes increased with increasing fasting\nplasma glucose levels, and those with FPG > 5.6mmol/L had higher adjusted hazard ratios. Additionally, \u201cthe association between fasting plasma\nglucose and incident pediatric diabetes and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were similar in boys and girls and were higher in\nthe age group twelve to eighteen years.\u201d In using 4.75 mmol/L as the optimal threshold for children six to eleven years, the sensitivity was 65% and\nspecificity was 51%. For the threshold of 5.19 mmol/L among children twelve to eighteen years, the sensitivity was 60% and the specificity was 73%.\nThis supports utilizing FPG as a supplement for diagnosing prediabetes among pediatric patients, which may contribute to better disease management.\nGeifman-Holtzman, et al. (2010) assessed the correlation between fetal macrosomia and abnormal OGTT in pregnant individuals with term gestation and\nnegative glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24 to 28 weeks. They recruited patients who had estimated fetal weights >90th percentile and a negative 50g\nGCT. From 170 individuals over a five-month period, they found that 10 patients or 5.9% had \u201cimpaired glucose metabolism at term.\u201d In this group, \u201cwe\nfound no correlation between GCT values at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks, family history of diabetes mellitus, the patient\u2019s [body mass index] or\nweight at term, and the diagnosis of impaired glucose metabolism.\u201d Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in mean fetal weight\nbetween those with normal versus abnormal OGTT. This demonstrated the lack of clinical utility of using OGTT at term for predicting the incidence of\nfetal macrosomia. The researchers suggested utilizing a larger scale study to solidify or contradict these conclusions.\nBi, et al. (2024) engaged in a cross-sectional study of participants aged >20 years old who underwent physical examination at the local hospital from\n2022 to 2023. A model was used to assess the dose-response relationship between liver enzymes and type 2 diabetes risk. Of the 14,100 participants,\nan analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between liver enzymes and\u00a0type 2 diabetes risk (P non-linear < 0.001). Specifically, type 2 diabetes risk\nincreased with rising ALT and GGT levels (range, <50 IU/L) and then leveled out when ALT and GGT levels were >50 IU/L. An elevated AST within a\ncertain range (range, <35 IU/L) decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes, but a mildly elevated AST (>35 IU/L) showed as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\nIn conclusion, liver enzymes were associated non-linearly with type 2 diabetes risk in different populations. Higher ALT and GGT levels were shown in\nthis study to increase type 2 diabetes risk as well. In conclusion, additional attention should be paid to elevated liver enzymes and diabetes, but more\nwork also needs to be done to assess association between elevation and T2D risk.\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA)\nThe ADA publishes an extensive guideline encompassing the standards of medical care in diabetes.

The recommendations concerning diabetes testing for children and adolescents are as follows:\n\u201cRisk-based screening for prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or \u226510 years of age, whichever\noccurs earlier, in youth with overweight (BMI \u226585th percentile) or obesity (BMI \u226595th percentile) and who have one or more additional risk factors\nfor diabetes.\u201d46 Grading based on risk factors;\nMaternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child's gestation-Grade A\nFamily history of type 2 diabetes in first- or second-degree relative-Grade A\nRace/ethnicity (Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American, Pacific Islander)-Grade A\nSigns of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary\nsyndrome, or small-for-gestational-age birth weight)-Grade B.\n\u201cIf tests are normal, repeat screening at a minimum of 3-year intervals [Grade E], or more frequently if BMI is increasing [Grade C].\u201d\n\u201cFasting plasma glucose, 2-h plasma glucose during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and A1c can be used to test for prediabetes or [type 2]\ndiabetes in children and adolescents.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cChildren and adolescents with overweight or obesity in whom the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is being considered should have a panel of\npancreatic autoantibodies tested to exclude the possibility of autoimmune type 1 diabetes.\u201d Grade B\n8,46\n2\n2\n46\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n7/15\n\u201cAlthough A1c is not recommended for diagnosis of diabetes in children with cystic fibrosis or symptoms suggestive of acute onset of type 1\ndiabetes and only A1c assays without interference are appropriate for children with hemoglobinopathies, ADA continues to recommend A1c for\ndiagnosis of type 2 diabetes in this population (ungraded)\u201d\n\u201cA1C goals must be individualized and reassessed over time. An A1C of <7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate for many children\u201d Grade B.\nPregnancy (Ch 15)\n\u201c\u2026although A1c may be useful, it should be used as a secondary measure of glycemic control in pregnancy, after blood glucose monitoring.\u201d\n\u201cFasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring are recommended in individuals with diabetes in pregnancy to achieve optimal\nglucose levels. Glucose goals are fasting plasma glucose <95 mg/dL (<5.3 mmol/L) and either 1-h postprandial glucose <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L)\nor 2-h postprandial glucose <120 mg/dL (<6.7 mmol/L) Grade B\u201d\n\u201cDue to increased red blood cell turnover, A1C is slightly lower during pregnancy in people with and without diabetes. Ideally, the A1C goal in\npregnancy is <6% (<42 mmol/mol) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, but the goal may be relaxed to <7% (<53 mmol/mol) if\nnecessary to prevent hypoglycemia Grade B\u201d\n\u201cGiven the alteration in red blood cell kinetics during pregnancy and physiological changes in glycemic parameters, A1c levels may need \u201cto be\nmonitored more frequently than usual (e.g., monthly).\u201d\n\u201cThe OGTT is recommended over A1C at four to twelve weeks postpartum because A1C may be persistently impacted (lowered) by the increased\nred blood cell turnover related to pregnancy, by blood loss at delivery, or by the preceding three-month glucose profile. The OGTT is more\nsensitive at detecting glucose intolerance, including both prediabetes and diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cBecause GDM often represents previously undiagnosed prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, or even developing\ntype 1 diabetes, individuals with GDM should be tested for persistent diabetes or prediabetes at four to twelve weeks postpartum with a fasting\n75-g OGTT using nonpregnancy criteria as outlined in Section two, \u201cClassification and Diagnosis of Diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, a positive screen for diabetes requires two abnormal values. If both the fasting plasma glucose\n(\u2265126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L]) and 2-h plasma glucose (\u2265200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]) are abnormal in a single screening test, then the diagnosis of\ndiabetes is made. If only one abnormal value in the OGTT meets diabetes criteria, the test should be repeated to confirm that the abnormality\npersists.\u201d\n\u201cIndividuals with a history of GDM should have ongoing screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes every 1\u20133 years, even if the results of the\ninitial 4\u201312 week postpartum 75-g OGTT are normal. Ongoing evaluation may be performed with any recommended glycemic test (e.g., annual\nA1C, annual fasting plasma glucose, or triennial 75-g OGTT using thresholds for nonpregnant individuals).\u201d\nHeart Failure Considerations (ch. 10)\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals, routine screening for coronary artery disease is not recommended, as it does not improve outcomes as long as\nASCVD risk factors are treated.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cConsider investigations for coronary artery disease in the presence of any of the following: atypical cardiac symptoms; signs or symptoms of\nassociated vascular disease, including carotid bruits, transient ischemic attack, stroke, claudication, or PAD; or electrocardiogram abnormalities\n(e.g., Q waves).\u201d Grade E\n\u201cAdults with diabetes are at increased risk for the development of asymptomatic cardiac structural or functional abnormalities (stage B heart\nfailure) or symptomatic (stage C) heart failure. Consider screening adults with diabetes by measuring a natriuretic peptide (B-type natriuretic\npeptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-BNP [NTproBNP]) to facilitate prevention of stage C heart failure.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and abnormal natriuretic peptide levels, echocardiography is recommended to identify stage B heart\nfailure.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and age \u226550 years, microvascular disease in any location, or foot complications or any end-organ\ndamage from diabetes, screening for PAD with ankle-brachial index testing is recommended to guide treatment for cardiovascular disease\nprevention and limb preservation. A In individuals with diabetes duration \u226510 years, screening for PAD should be considered\u201d Grade B.\nNonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis & Chronic Kidney Disease (ch. 4 and ch. 11)\nFrom chapter 4:\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, particularly those with obesity or cardiometabolic risk factors or established cardiovascular disease,\nshould be screened/risk stratified for clinically significant liver fibrosis (defined as moderate fibrosis to cirrhosis) using a calculated fibrosis-4\nindex (FIB-4) (derived from age, ALT, AST, and platelets\u2026even if they have normal liver enzymes.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with diabetes or prediabetes with persistently elevated plasma aminotransferase levels for >6 months and low FIB-4 should be evaluated\nfor other causes of liver disease.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with an indeterminate or high FIB-4 should have additional risk stratification by liver stiffness\nmeasurement with transient elastography or the blood biomarker enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF).\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with indeterminate results or at high risk for significant liver fibrosis (i.e., by FIB-4, liver stiffness\nmeasurement, or ELF) should be referred to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for further workup. Interprofessional care is recommended for\nlong-term management Grade B.\u201d\nFrom chapter 11:\nAdditionally: \u201cA screening strategy based on elevated plasma aminotransferases >40 units/L would miss most individuals with NASH in these settings,\nas clinically significant fibrosis (\u2265F2) is frequently observed with plasma aminotransferases below the commonly used cutoff of 40 units/L. The American\nCollege of Gastroenterology considers the upper limit of normal ALT levels to be 29\u201333 units/L for male individuals and 19\u201325 units/L for female\nindividuals, as higher levels are associated with increased liver-related mortality, even in the absence of identifiable risk factors. The FIB-4 estimates\nthe risk of hepatic cirrhosis and is calculated from the computation of age, plasma aminotransferases (AST and ALT), and platelet count.\u201d\nIn regards to A1c and NASH, the ADA restricts its comments to the following: \u201cThe only proven primary prevention interventions for CKD in people with\ndiabetes are blood glucose (A1C goal of 7%) and blood pressure control (blood pressure <130/80 mmHg),\u201d and \u201cIntensive lowering of blood glucose with\nthe goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large, randomized studies to delay the onset and progression of albuminuria and reduce\neGFR in people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Insulin alone was used to lower blood glucose in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial\n(DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study of type 1 diabetes, while a variety of agents were used in clinical trials of type\n2 diabetes, supporting the conclusion that lowering blood glucose itself helps prevent CKD and its progression. The effects of glucose-lowering\ntherapies on CKD have helped define A1C goals.\u201d\nHospital Care Delivery Standards and Perioperative Care (ch. 16)\n49\n50\n51\n52,53\n54\n54\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n8/15\n\u201cPerform an A1C test on all people with diabetes or hyperglycemia (random blood glucose >140 mg/dL [>7.8 mmol/L]) admitted to the hospital if\nno A1C test result is available from the prior 3 months.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn hospitalized individuals with diabetes who are eating, point-of-care (POC) blood glucose monitoring should be performed before meals; in\nthose not eating, glucose monitoring is advised every 4\u20136 h. More frequent POC blood glucose monitoring ranging from every 30 min to every 2 h\nis the required standard for safe use of intravenous insulin therapy.\u201d (No grade; statement)\nThe following approach may be considered for those in preoperative and perioperative care:\n\u201cA preoperative risk assessment should be performed for people with diabetes who are at high risk for ischemic heart disease and those with\nautonomic neuropathy or renal failure.\nThe A1C goal for elective surgeries should be <8% (<63.9 mmol/L) whenever possible.\nThe blood glucose goal in the perioperative period should be 100\u2013180 mg/dL (5.6\u201310.0 mmol/L) within 4 h of the surgery. CGM should not be\nused alone for glucose monitoring during surgery.\nMetformin should be held on the day of surgery.\nSGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued 3\u20134 days before surgery.\nHold other oral glucose-lowering agents the morning of surgery or procedure and give one-half of NPH dose or 75\u201380% doses of long-acting\nanalog insulin or adjust insulin pump basal rates based on the type of diabetes and clinical judgment.\nMonitor blood glucose at least every 2\u20134 h while the individual takes nothing by mouth and dose with short- or rapid-acting insulin as needed.\nThere is little data on the safe use and/or influence of GLP-1 receptor agonists on glycemia and delayed gastric emptying in the perioperative\nperiod.\nStricter perioperative glycemic goals are not advised, as perioperative glycemic goals stricter than 80\u2013180 mg/dL (4.4\u201310.0 mmol/L) may not\nimprove outcomes and are associated with more hypoglycemia.\nCompared with usual dosing, a reduction by 25% of basal insulin given the evening before surgery is more likely to achieve perioperative blood\nglucose goals with a lower risk for hypoglycemia.\nIn individuals undergoing noncardiac general surgery, basal insulin plus premeal short- or rapid-acting insulin (basal-bolus) coverage has been\nassociated with improved glycemic outcomes and lower rates of perioperative complications compared with the reactive, correction-only short- or\nrapid-acting insulin coverage alone with no basal insulin dosing.\u201d\nThe ADA did not specifically mention \u201cbariatric surgery\u201d in their hospital care delivery section (ch. 16).\nDiabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee\nThis Expert Committee published a comprehensive guideline on the prevention and management of diabetes. Relevant items, recommendations, and\ncomments\u2014particularly those relating to the use of A1c testing\u2014are captured below:\n\u201cScreen for type 2 diabetes using a fasting plasma glucose and/or glycated hemoglobin (A1C) every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or\nin individuals at high risk on a risk calculator (33% chance of developing diabetes over ten years).\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of evidence for interventions to prevent or delay type 1 diabetes, routine screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended.\u201d\n\u201cFor most individuals with diabetes, A1C should be measured approximately every three months to ensure that glycemic goals are being met or\nmaintained. In some circumstances, such as when significant changes are made to therapy, or during pregnancy, it is appropriate to check A1C\nmore frequently. Testing at least every six months should be performed in adults during periods of treatment and healthy behavior stability when\nglycemic targets have been consistently achieved.\u201d\nA1C can be misleading in various medical conditions (\u201ce.g., hemoglobinopathies, iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia, severe hepatic or renal\ndisease\u201d) and should not be used for \u201cdiagnostic use in children and adolescents (as the sole diagnostic test), pregnant [individuals] as part of\nroutine screening for gestational diabetes, those with cystic fibrosis or those with suspected type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nDiabetes \u201cshould\u201d be diagnosed at a level of A1C \u22656.5%.\n\u201cScreening for diabetes using FPG and/or A1C should be performed every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or at high risk using a risk\ncalculator [Grade D, Consensus]. Earlier testing and/or more frequent follow up (every six to twelve months) with either FPG and/or A1C should\nbe considered in those at very high risk using a risk calculator or in people with additional risk factors for diabetes [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d\nIt should be mentioned that \u201cGlycemic targets should be individualized [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d based upon various considerations including, but not\nlimited to, the patient\u2019s functional dependence, medical history, life expectancy, and life course stage. Moreover, the grading of recommendations above\n(e.g., \u201cGrade D\u201d) reflect the methodological rigor used at arriving at the conclusion, such that lower grades reflect the presence of weaker evidence. But\nthough the \u201cpaucity of clinical evidence addressing the areas of therapy, prevention, diagnosis or prognosis precluded the assignment of a higher\ngrade,\u201d the authors recognize and note that many Grade D recommendations are \u201cvery important to the contemporary management of diabetes.\u201d\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)\nThe USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who are overweight or obese, and such\n\u201cScreening tests for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes include measurement of fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c level or an oral glucose tolerance test.\u201d\nRecognizing that \u201cThe optimal screening interval for adults with an initial normal glucose test result is uncertain,\u201d the USPSTF suggests that \u201cScreening\nevery three years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels.\u201d\nThe USPSTF has also provided guidelines pertaining to the screening of gestational diabetes. For asymptomatic pregnant persons at 24 weeks\ngestation or after, with a letter \u201cB\u201d grade, the USPSTF recommends screening for gestational diabetes in this population. However, in asymptomatic\npregnant persons before 24 weeks gestation, the USPSTF states that \u201ccurrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of\nscreening\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nAn \u201cI\u201d grade is defined by the USPSTF as \u201cI Statement- The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits\nand harms cannot be determined.\u201d\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n9/15\nIn 2022, the USPSTF released its first recommendation on screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. This recommendation applies to\nchildren and adolescents who are not pregnant and who are younger than 18 years of age without known diabetes or prediabetes and who are without\nsymptoms of diabetes or prediabetes. The USPSTF states that the goal of screening for type 2 diabetes in young people is \u201cto diagnose and treat it\nearly to prevent development of bad health outcomes. However, no studies have looked at the link between screening for type 2 diabetes in children and\nadolescents and bad health outcomes. Studies about the effect of type 2 diabetes treatment on health outcomes in children and adolescents have not\nhad enough patients with bad outcomes to draw any meaningful conclusions. No studies have looked at harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in young\npeople. Potential harms may include side effects from medications used to treat diabetes, such as low blood glucose, nausea, or vomiting.\u201d Based on\nthe current evidence for asymptomatic children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age, the USPSTF concluded that \u201ccurrent evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)\nThe Global Report on Diabetes states that: \u201cGlycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the method of choice for monitoring glycaemic control in diabetes. An\nadvantage of using HbA1c is that the patient does not need to be in a fasting state. Ideally it should be measured twice a year in people\u00a0with type 2\ndiabetes and more frequently in those with type 1 diabetes. However, HbA1c testing is more costly than glucose measurement, and therefore less\nreadily available. If HbA1c testing is not available, fasting, or post-meal blood glucose is an acceptable substitute.\u201d\nThe WHO also published a \u201cmodule\u201d titled \u201cHearts-D: Diagnosis and Management of Type 2 Diabetes in 2020. In it, a testing algorithm for \u201ctreatment of\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin\u201d is included at the bottom. The algorithm calls for an HbA1c assessment to be performed \u201cin three months\u201d if the\npatient is stabilized as a result of the insulin treatment.\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)\nIn 2022, the AAFP published a clinical summary of the USPSTF recommendation for screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The\ndocument deferred to the USPSTF recommendations, with the testing audience being \u201cNonpregnant adults aged thirty-five to seventy years who have\noverweight or obesity and no symptoms of diabetes\u201d\u2014a move from 40 years of age in the previous recommendation\u2014while deeming screening every\nthree years to be a reasonable approach.\nEndocrine Society\nThe Endocrine Society published this guideline regarding management of diabetes in older adults. In it, they recommend screening for prediabetes or\ndiabetes every two years for patients 65 years or older. FPG and/or HbA1c may be used. However, the Society does recommend caution when\ninterpreting HbA1c results, as older patients are more likely to have conditions that alter red blood cell turnover.\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\nNICE published an update to their guideline on diabetes management. In it, they make the following recommendations:\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c levels in adults with type 2 diabetes every:\nThree to six months (tailored to individual needs) until HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy.\nSix months once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable.\u201d\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c using methods calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardization.\u201d\n\u201cIf HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type, estimate trends in blood glucose control using\none of the following:\nquality-controlled plasma glucose profiles\ntotal glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)\nfructosamine estimation.\u201d\n\u201cInvestigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes\nor clinical biochemistry.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)\nThe AACE provides the following inclusion criteria for individuals who should be screened for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes:\nAge \u226545 years without other risk factors\nCVD or family history of T2D\nOverweight or obese\nSedentary lifestyle\nMember of an at-risk racial or ethnic group:\nAsian\nAfrican American\nHispanic\nNative American (Alaska Natives and American Indians)\nPacific Islander\nHigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level >250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L)\nImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and/or metabolic syndrome\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), acanthosis nigricans, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\nHypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg or on antihypertensive therapy)\nHistory of gestational diabetes or delivery of a baby weighing more than 5 kg (9 lb)\nAntipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia and/or severe bipolar disease\nChronic glucocorticoid exposure\nSleep disorders in the presence of glucose intolerance (A1C >5.7%, IGT, or IFG on previous testing), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),\nchronic sleep deprivation, and night-shift occupation\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n10/15\nThe AACE recommends repeat testing at least every three years for individuals with normal results. Consider annual screening for patients with two or\nmore risk factors.\nIn a 2022 update focusing on developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan, the AACE expounds on how the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus\nshould be made. According to the authors, the ELs refer to evidence levels established by AACE evidence ratings, where \u201cdescriptors of \u201cmust,\u201d\n\u201cshould,\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d generally but not strictly correlate with Grade A (strong), Grade B (intermediate), and Grade C (weak) recommendations,\nrespectively.\u201d\nThe relevant recommendations are captured below.\n\u201cRecommendation 1.1\nThe diagnosis of DM is based on the following criteria\u2026:\nFPG concentration \u2265126 mg/dL (after \u2265 eight hours of an overnight fast), or\nPlasma glucose (PG) concentration \u2265200 mg/dL two hours after ingesting a 75-g oral glucose load after an overnight fast of at least eight hours,\nor\nSymptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia) and a random (nonfasting) PG concentration \u2265200 mg/dL, or\nA1C level \u22656.5%\nDiagnosis of DM requires two abnormal test results, either from the same sample or two abnormal results on samples drawn on different days. However,\na glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms for DM confirms the diagnosis of DM.\nGrade A; BEL 2 and expert opinion of task force\nRecommendation 1.2\nPrediabetes is identified by the presence of IFG (100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), which is a PG value of 140 to 199 mg/dL two\nhours after ingesting 75 g of glucose, and/or A1C value between 5.7% and 6.4% (Table 4). A1C should be used only for screening for prediabetes. The\ndiagnosis of prediabetes, which may manifest as either IFG or IGT, should be confirmed with glucose testing.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.3\nT1D is characterized by marked insulin deficiency in the presence of hyperglycemia and positive autoantibody tests to glutamic acid decarboxylase\n(GAD65), pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells (tyrosine phosphatase IA-2), and IA-2b zinc transporter (ZnT8), and/or insulin. The presence of immune markers and\nclinical presentation are needed to establish the correct diagnosis and to distinguish between T1D and T2D in children or adults, as well as to determine\nappropriate treatment.\nGrade A; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.4\nT2D is characterized by progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion and variable defects in insulin sensitivity. T2D is often asymptomatic and can remain\nundiagnosed for many years; therefore, all adults \u226535 years of age with risk factors should be screened for DM (Table 5).\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.5\nGDM is defined as carbohydrate intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy and resolves postpartum. Pregnant individuals with risk\nfactors for DM should be screened at the first prenatal visit for undiagnosed T2D using standard criteria (Table 4).\nGrade B; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.6\nScreen all pregnant individuals for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Diagnose GDM with either the one-step or the two-step\napproach.\nThe one-step approach uses a two-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after \u2265 eight hours of fasting with diagnostic cutoffs of one or\nmore FPG \u226592 mg/dL, one-hour PG \u2265180 mg/dL, or two-hour PG \u2265153 mg/dL.\nThe two-step approach uses a nonfasting one-hour 50-g glucose challenge test with one-hour PG screening threshold of 130 or 140 mg/dL. For\nindividuals with a positive screening test, the three-hour 100-g OGTT is used for diagnosis with two or more PG tests that meet the following\nthresholds: FPG \u226595 mg/dL, 1-hour \u2265180 mg/dL, 2-hour \u2265155 mg/dL, 3-hour \u2265140 mg/dL.\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.7\nClinicians should consider evaluation for monogenic DM in any child or young adult with an atypical presentation, clinical course, or response to\ntherapy. Monogenic DM includes neonatal diabetes and nonautoimmune diabetes of multiple genetic causes, also known as maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young (MODY). Most children with DM occurring under six months of age have a monogenic cause as autoimmune T1D rarely occurs before six\nmonths of age. Other monogenic forms of diabetes are characterized by mutation of genes of transcription factors, genes regulating pancreatic\ndevelopment or atrophy, abnormal insulin genes, genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress that impair insulin secretion, or abnormal glucokinase\ngenes that cause impaired insulin signaling.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nAlthough not expressly listed as recommendations for diabetes screening, some additional information of note includes the following:\n\u201cA glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of hyperglycemia symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia confirm the diagnosis of DM. In\nindividuals with discordant results from two different tests, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated on a different\nday.\u201d\n\u201cIn view of physiological changes in pregnancy that could affect glycated hemoglobin levels, A1C should not be used for GDM screening or\ndiagnosis of DM.\u201d\n66\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n11/15\n\u201cAll pregnant individuals should be screened for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Universal screening is recommended, as\nselective screening (only in individuals with risk factors) would miss a significant number of individuals with GDM and universal screening has\nbeen shown to be cost-effective compared with selective screening.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE)\nThe 2020 Consensus Statement from the AACE/ACE on the Management of Type 2 Diabetes states:\n\"The hemoglobin A1c (A1c) target should be individualized based on numerous factors such as age, life expectancy, comorbid conditions,\nduration of diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia or adverse consequences from hypoglycemia, patient motivation, and adherence.\"\n\u201cAn A1c level of \u22646.5% is considered optimal if it can be achieved in a safe and affordable manner, but higher targets may be appropriate for\ncertain individuals and may change for a given individual over time.\u201d\n\u201cTherapy must be evaluated frequently (e.g., every three months) until stable using multiple criteria, including A1c, SMBG records (fasting and\npostprandial) or continuous glucose monitoring tracings, documented and suspected hypoglycemia events, lipid and BP values, adverse events\n(weight gain, fluid retention, hepatic or renal impairment, or CVD), comorbidities, other relevant laboratory data, concomitant drug administration,\ncomplications of diabetes, and psychosocial factors affecting patient care. Less frequent monitoring is acceptable once targets are achieved.\u201d\nIn 2023, the AACE/ACE released \u201cGuidelines and Recommendations for Laboratory Analysis in the Diagnosis and Management of Diabetes Mellitus.\u201d\nDiagnosis related recommendations:\n\u201cFasting glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used to establish the diagnosis of diabetes, with a value \u22657.0 mmol/L (\u2265126 mg/dL)\ndiagnostic of diabetes. A (high)\u201d\nScreening related recommendations:\n\u201cRecommendation: Screening by HbA1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT is recommended for individuals who are at high risk of diabetes. If HbA1c is <5.7%\n(<39 mmol/mol), FPG is <5.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL), and/or 2-h plasma glucose is <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year\nintervals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used for screening of high-risk individuals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Plasma glucose should be measured in an accredited laboratory when used for diagnosis of or screening for diabetes. GPP\n(good practice point)\u201d\nMonitoring/Prognosis:\n\u201cRecommendation: Routine measurement of plasma glucose concentrations in a laboratory is not recommended as the primary means of\nmonitoring or evaluating therapy in individuals with diabetes. B (moderate)\u201d\nKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Diabetes Working Group\nThe KDIGO group published recommendations on diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). They recommend using HbA1c to monitor diabetic and\nCKD patients twice a year or as often as four times a year if glycemic target is not met or a change is made in therapy. KDIGO advises that \"accuracy\nand precision of HbA1c measurement declines with advanced CKD, particularly among patients treated by dialysis, in whom HbA1c measurements have\nlow reliability.\" They also recommend an \"individualized HbA1c target ranging from <6.5% to <8.0% in patients with diabetes and CKD not treated with\ndialysis.\u201d\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a condition where there is a buildup of fat in the liver. It is seen in individuals who\ndrink little to no alcohol but who have\u00a0diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. Diabetes is both a possible cause of and or symptom\nof MASLD: while diabetes is a risk factor for developing MASLD, individuals who have been diagnosed with MASLD may be at risk for developing heart\ndisease and diabetes.",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\nPrevalence: In 2021, 38.4 million Americans, or 11.6% of the population, had diabetes. Approximately 1.9 million American children and adults\nhave type 1 diabetes, including about 244,000 children and adolescents.\nDiagnosed and undiagnosed: Of the 38.4 million, 29.7 million were diagnosed, and 8.7 million were undiagnosed.\nPrevalence in seniors: The percentage of Americans aged 65 and older remains high, at 29.2%, or 15.9 million seniors (diagnosed and\nundiagnosed).\nNew cases: 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year.\nPrediabetes: In 2021, 97.6 million Americans aged eighteen and older had prediabetes.\nDeaths: Diabetes remains the 8th leading cause of death in the United States in 2021, with 103,294 death certificates listing it as the underlying\ncause of death, and a total of 399.401 death certificates listing diabetes as a cause of death.\nTotal economic cost of diabetes care in the United States: $413 billion in 2022.\nDiabetes can be classified into the following categories:\n\u201cType 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune \u03b2-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency)\u201d\n\u201cType 2 diabetes (due to a progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background of insulin resistance)\u201d\n\u201cGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior\nto gestation)\u201d\n\u201cSpecific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young [MODY]), diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as\nwith glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, or after organ transplantation)\u201d  The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is easily established\nwhen a patient presents with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, which include polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, blurred vision, and, infrequently,\nweight loss. The frequency of symptomatic diabetes has been decreasing in parallel with improved efforts to diagnose diabetes earlier through\nscreening. Increasingly, the majority of patients are asymptomatic, and hyperglycemia is noted on routine laboratory evaluation, prompting further\ntesting.\n6,7\n8\n3\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n3/15\nGlycated hemoglobin A1c (also known as HbA1c, A1c, glycohemoglobin, or hemoglobin A1c) testing plays a key role in the management of diabetes.\nNew hemoglobin enters circulation with minimal glucose attached. However, glucose irreversibly binds to hemoglobin based on the surrounding blood\nglucose concentration. Therefore, A1c is considered a measure of blood glucose level, albeit an indirect one. It is best correlated with the mean glucose\nlevel over the last eight to twelve weeks as red blood cells experience significant turnover. Various factors may affect the reliability of A1c (atypical\nhemoglobins or hemoglobinopathies, chronic kidney disease, et al.), but most assays have been standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications\nTrial (DCCT) standard, which \u201cestimated the mean blood glucose concentrations derived from seven measurements a day (before and ninety minutes\nafter each of the three major\u00a0meals, and before bedtime), performed once every three months and compared the average glucose concentration with\nA1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nThe HbA1c assay provides information about the degree of long-term glucose control,  and has been recommended for the diagnosis and monitoring of\ndiabetes.\nVarious methods of HbA1c measurement include chromatography based HPLC assay, boronate affinity, antibody-based immunoassay, and\nenzyme based enzymatic assay.\nLong-term blood sugar control has been associated with decreased risk of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and\ncardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial, cerebrovascular disease,\nand myocardial fibrosis in adults with diabetes.\nHigher HbA1c variability has\nbeen associated with higher all-cause mortality in patients with Type 2 Diabetes.\nFasting plasma glucose is a method of glucose monitoring that measures an individual\u2019s glucose level typically in a period defined with no caloric intake\nfor eight hours or more. Its usage in the diagnosis of diabetes lies primarily in gestational diabetes, along with the OGTT, but HbA1c, FPG, or OGTTs\nwith their respective positive results can be used in diagnosing diabetes mellitus in nonpregnant individuals as well. To diagnose diabetes in\nasymptomatic individuals, a FPG has to be \u2265 126 mg/dL. For diagnosing prediabetes, an individual may have \u201cimpaired fasting glucose,\u201d which would\npresent with a range of 100-125 mg/Dl.\nTraditionally, the diagnosis of diabetes was predicated on plasma glucose levels as well as symptom presentation. In 2010, the ADA endorsed as a\n\u201creliable retrospective marker of blood glucose control over the past 6-8 weeks.\u201d The advantages of HbA1c testing include increased convenience,\nincreased stability and decreased variation in measurement. While the ADA 2023 guidelines gave precedence to FPG, the latest 2024 guideline\naddressed the vital importance of HbA1c for both diagnostic and screening purposes (for both diabetes and prediabetes care).\nThe ADA notes that there are areas where HbA1c is insufficient and plasma glucose levels are the preferred measurement: \u201cIn the presence of\nhemoglobin variants, pregnancy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and other conditions that might potentially interfere with accurate\nHbA1c measurements, plasma glucose levels are preferred. Furthermore, in situations where elevated blood glucose levels might not be consistently\napparent, the diagnosis of diabetes necessitates two abnormal test results (HbA1c and plasma glucose) either simultaneously or at different time points.\nIn such scenarios, alternative biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin emerge as viable options for monitoring glycemic status.\nFructosamine reflects the total pool of glycated serum proteins, mainly albumin, reflecting glycemic trends over a span of two to four weeks\u2014a relatively\nshorter duration compared to A1C. Although these biomarkers show a strong correlation and are associated with long-term complications based on\nepidemiological evidence, the empirical support for their application is not as robust as that for HbA1c.\u201d\nThe OGTT can be more inconvenient and used in the setting to diagnose GDM. Normally, 75g of glucose is ingested by the patient, and if the patient\nhas a two-hour plasma glucose value of \u2265200 mg/dL, a diagnosis of diabetes can be made. The test can also be performed at one-hour with 50g oral\nglucose, with positive GDM diagnostic results between 130-140 mg/dL as part of a two-step approach with the three-hour 100g test, which can be\ndiagnostic of GDM with two elevated values. For prediabetes with an accompanied \u201cimpaired glucose tolerance,\u201d a two-hour plasma glucose value\nbetween 140-199 mg/dL is used. However, the WHO requires an additional FPG <126 in addition to the two-hour plasma glucose value to establish\nimpaired glucose tolerance.\nAnalytical Validity\nThe International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Working Group on HbA1c Standardization has developed a reference\nmeasurement system and the measurement of HbA1c is currently well-standardized,\nand a sound reference system is in place to ensure continuity and\nstability of the analytical validity of HbA1c measurement.\nIn contrast, plasma glucose concentration remains difficult to assay with consistent\naccuracy.\nHbA1c has greater analytical stability (consistency with repetitive sample testing) and less day-to-day variability than either the fasting\nplasma glucose (FPG)or two-hour PG.\nFor any given individual, the HbA1c exhibits little short-term biologic variability; its coefficient of variation\n(CV) is 3.6%, compared to FPG (CV of 5.7%) and 2-h PG (CV of 16.6%).\nA sample proficiency testing survey performed by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and College of American Pathologists\n(CAP) evaluated the accuracy of A1c assays. The survey found that \u201cmethod-specific, between-laboratory CV\u2019s ranged from 0.7% to 4.0%\u201d and\n\u201capproximately 85% of laboratories are using methods with CVs <3% at all five HbA1c levels.\u201d The survey also noted the current pass limit was \u00b16%, but\nusing a pass rate of 97.1% to 98.0% of labs passed.\nClinical Utility and Validity\nTesting A1c, FPG, and 2-h PG measure different aspects of glycemia and are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1c \u22656.5% identifies fewer\nindividuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria; however, a recent study concluded that twelve percent of patients can be misclassified with\nrespect to diabetes diagnosis due to laboratory instrument error in measuring glucose.\nThe New Hoorn Study analyzed the diagnostic properties of the\nA1c, using OGTT as the diagnostic criterion.\nThe analysis suggested that an A1c of 5.8% had a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 91%. This\ncompares with specificity of 24% and sensitivity of 99% for the A1c cut point of 6.5%. On the other hand, the 6.5% cut point had a positive predictive\nvalue of 93%, compared with a positive predictive value of only 24% for a cut point of 5.8%.\nWhen using the reference diagnosis of diabetes being a two-hour blood glucose >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT, the specificity of FPG \u2265126\nmg/dL was >95% and sensitivity about 50%, with possibly lower sensitivities and specificities for individuals over 65 years.27 With the same OGTT\nreference, the specificity and sensitivity of an A1c \u22656.5%, as per diagnosis of diabetes, were reported as 79% and 44%, respectively.\nCowie, et al. (2010) \u201cexamined prevalence\u2019s of previously diagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes and high risk for diabetes using recently\nsuggested A1c criteria in the U.S. during 2003\u20132006. We compared these prevalence\u2019s to those in earlier surveys and those using glucose criteria.\u201d\n14,611 individuals were included (completed a household interview) and classified for diagnosed diabetes and by A1c, fasting, and 2-h glucose\nchallenge values. Diagnostic values for A1c were \u22656.5% for \u201cundiagnosed\u201d diabetes and 6%-6.5% for \u201chigh risk\u201d of diabetes. The authors found that by\nthese A1c diagnostic values, the \u201ccrude prevalence\u201d of diabetes in adults older than twenty years was 20.4 million, of which nineteen percent went\nundiagnosed based on A1c \u2265 6.5%. The authors then stated that the A1c criteria only diagnosed thirty percent of the undiagnosed diabetic group.\n5\n9\n8,10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n3,4\n15\n4,16\n17\n18\n19\n20,21\n22,23\n24\n25\n26\n22\n28\n29\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n4/15\nMamtora, et al. (2021) assessed the clinical utility of point-of-care (POC) HbA1c testing in the ophthalmology outpatient setting. Forty-nine patients with\ndiabetic retinopathy underwent POC HbA1c testing and blood pressure measurement. Of the 49 patients, 81.6% had POC readings above the\nrecommended HbA1c levels and only 16.3% of these patients were aware of their elevated HbA1c levels. Fourteen patients (33.3%) with high HbA1c\nreadings were referred to secondary diabetic services and 88.8% of patients felt like the test was useful. The authors suggest that POC HbA1c testing is\na \"cost-effective, reproducible and clinically significant tool for the management of diabetes in an outpatient ophthalmology setting, allowing the rapid\nrecognition of high-risk patients and appropriate referral to secondary diabetic services.\"\nGoodney, et al. (2016) evaluated the consistency of A1c testing of diabetes patients and its effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The study included\n1574415 Medicare patients with diabetes mellitus, and the consistency of testing was separated into three categories: \u201clow (testing in zero or one of\nthree years), medium (testing in two of three years), and high (testing in all three years).\u201d Approximately 70.2% of patients received high-consistency\ntesting, 17.6% received medium-consistency, and 12.2% received low-consistency. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) included \u201cdeath,\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, amputation, or the need for leg revascularization.\u201d Low-consistency patients was associated with death or other adverse\nevents (hazard ratio: 1.21). The authors concluded that \u201cconsistent annual hemoglobin A1c testing is associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular\noutcomes in this observational cohort of Medicare patients of diabetes mellitus.\u201d\nThe GOAL study used A1c to assess diabetes control in a real-world practice study aimed to assess predictive factors for achieving the glycemic\nhemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at six months as targeted by the treating physician in adults with type 2 diabetes. In this study, 2704 patients with a mean A1c\nof 9.7% were enrolled. After six months, lower baseline A1c (\u2265 8.5% vs <7%) was found to be a predictive factor for achieving glycemic control. The\nauthors also observed \u201cabsolute changes in the mean HbA1c of \u22121.7% and \u22122% were observed from baseline to six and twelve months, respectively.\u201d\nMitsios, et al. (2018) evaluated the association between A1c and stroke risk. Twenty-nine studies (n=532779) were included. The authors compared the\nnon-diabetic A1c range (<5.7%) to the diabetic range (\u22656.5%) and found that the diabetic range was associated with a 2.15-fold increased risk of first-\never stroke. The prediabetes range of 5.7%-6.5% was also not associated with first-ever stroke. The authors also observed that for every one percent\nincrease in A1c, the hazard ratio of first-ever stroke increased (1.12-fold for non-diabetic ranges, 1.17 for diabetic ones). This increased risk was also\nseen for ischemic stroke, with a hazard ratio of 1.49 for non-diabetic ranges and 1.24 for diabetic ranges.\nLudvigsson, et al. (2019) evaluated the association between preterm birth risk and periconceptional HbA1c levels in pregnant individuals with type 1\ndiabetes (T1D). Preterm birth was defined as <37 weeks and several secondary outcomes were also examined, which were \u201cneonatal death, large-for-\ngestational age, macrosomia, infant birth injury, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, five-minute Apgar score less than seven, and stillbirth.\u201d A total of\n2474 singletons born to individuals with T1D and 1165216 reference infants (children born to mothers without T1D) were included. The authors identified\n552 preterm births in the T1D cohort (22.3%) compared to 54287 in the control cohort (4.7%). Incidences of preterm birth were measured at several\nseparate thresholds, including <6.5%, 6.5%-7.8%, 7.8%-9.1%, and >9.1%. The T1D cohort\u2019s adjusted risk ratios (aRR) of preterm birth compared to the\ncontrol cohort were as\u00a0follows: 2.83 for <6.5%, 4.22 for 6.5%-7.8%, 5.56 for 7.8%-9.1%, and 6.91 for >9.1%. The corresponding aRRs for \u201cmedically\nindicated preterm birth\u201d (n=320) were 5.26, 7.42, 11.75 and 17.51, respectively. Increased HbA1c levels were also found to be associated with the\nsecondary clinical outcomes. The authors concluded that \u201cthe risk for preterm birth was strongly linked to periconceptional HbA1c levels.\nSaito, et al. (2019) examined the association of HbA1c variability (defined as visit-to-visit) and later onset of malignancies. The authors included 2640\npatients 50 years or older, with diabetes. A total of 330 patients (12.5%) developed malignancies during follow up. The authors stratified the patients\ninto quartiles of glycemic variability (defined as standard deviation of HbA1c) and found a \u201cdose-dependent association with tumorigenesis\u201d in the three\nhighest quartiles. The odds ratios were as follows: 1.20 for the second quartile, 1.43 for the third, and 2.19 for the highest. The authors concluded that\n\u201cthese results demonstrated that visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is a potential risk factor for later tumorigenesis. The association may be mediated by\noxidative stress or hormone variability.\u201d\nMa\u00f1\u00e9, et al. (2019) evaluated the \u201csuitability of first-trimester fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels in non-diabetic range to identify [individuals]\nwithout diabetes at increased pregnancy risk.\u201d Primary outcomes were defined as \u201cmacrosomia and pre-eclampsia\u201d and secondary outcomes were\ndefined as \u201cpreterm delivery, Caesarean section and large-for-gestational age.\u201d A total of 1228 pregnancies were included. Pregnant individuals with an\nHbA1c of \u22655.8% were found to have an increased risk of marcosomia (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69), an HbA1c of \u22655.9% was found to be associated with a\nthree-fold risk of pre-eclampsia, and an HbA1c of \u22656% was found to be associated with a four-fold risk of \u201clarge-for-gestational age.\u201d FPG levels were\nnot found to be associated with any pregnancy outcome.\nArbiol-Roca, et al. (2021) studied the clinical utility of HbA1c testing as a biomarker for detecting GDM and as a screening test to avoid the use of the\nOGTT. HbA1c levels were measured in 745 pregnant individuals and GDM was diagnosed in 38 patients based on HbA1c, age, and BMI. A cut off HbA1c\nvalue of 4.6% was determined to decide whether OGTT was needed or if it could be avoided. Using 4.6% HbA1c as the cut off value prevented two false\nnegatives, but only decreased the number of OGTTs performed by 7.2%. The authors conclude that \"adoption of HbA1c as a screening test for GDM may\neliminate the need of OGTT.\" Although the HbA1c test does not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as the sole diagnostic test, \"the use\nof a rule-out strategy in combination with the OGTT could be useful.\"\nHowever, the use of hemoglobin A1c testing is not useful in predicting all forms of dysglycemia. Tommerdahl, et al. (2019) evaluated several biomarkers\nfor their accuracy in screening for cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes. These biomarkers included \u201chemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 1,5-anhydroglucitol\n(1,5AG), fructosamine (FA), and glycated albumin (GA)\u201d and were compared to the current gold standard, OGTT 2-hour glucose. Fifty-eight patients with\nCF were included and \u201carea under the receiver operative characteristic (ROC-AUC) curves were generated.\u201d All ROC-AUCs for each biomarker were\n\u201clow\u201d both for cystic fibrosis-related prediabetes (CFPD, ROC-AUC 0.52-0.67) and CF-related diabetes (CFRD) (0.56-0.61). For CFRD, HbA1c was\nmeasured to have a 78% sensitivity and 41% specificity at a cutoff of 5.5%, which corresponds to a ROC-AUC of 0.61. The authors concluded that \u201cAll\nalternate markers tested demonstrate poor diagnostic accuracy for identifying CFRD by 2hG.\u201d\nIn a retrospective review of the UMass Memorial Health System electronic medical records from between 1997 and 2019, Darukhanavala, et al. (2021)\nevaluated the appropriateness of HbA1c as a screening tool for identifying patients with pre-CFRD dysglycemia to minimize the burden of annual two-\nhour OGTTs. The study included 56 patients categorized according to OGTT results (American Diabetes Association criteria): normal glucose tolerance\n(n=34), indeterminant glycemia (INDET, n=6), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, n=7), or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n=9). It was found that HbA1c\nwas positively correlated with blood glucose levels at the various time cut points (hour zero, hour one, and hour two), though the associations were\nquite weak (r = 0.248, r = 0.219, and r = 0.369, respectively). Furthermore, t-tests conducted suggested that the mean HbA1c was not significantly\ndifferent between patients with normal glucose tolerance and those in the INDET (p = 0.987), IFG (p = 0.690), and IGT (p = 0.874) groups, confirmed by\nANOVA (p = 0.250). Consequently, the authors reported that the \u201cresults do not support the use of HbA1c as a possible screening tool for pre-CFRD\ndysglycemic states, specifically INDET, IFG, and IGT.\u201d\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n5/15\nBy combining administrative datasets from the Veterans Health Administration and Medicare, Zhao, et al. (2021) evaluated the impact of hemoglobin\nA1c (A1c) variability\u2014the CV, described by A1c standard deviation divided by the average A1c value overall and expressed as a percent\u2014on the risk of\nhypoglycemia-related hospitalization (HRH) in veterans with diabetes mellitus. In this study sample of 342,059 patients, the authors identified a\n\u201cconsistent and positive relationship between A1c variability and HRH\u201d and noted that \u201cAverage A1c levels were also significantly and independently\nassociated with HRH, with levels <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) associated with lower risk and levels >9% (75 mmol/mol) conferring greater risk.\u201d Due to these\ndifferent levels of variability all remaining strong predictors of HRH risk up to three years following the baseline period, authors concluded that \u201ctracking\nA1c levels alone may be insufficient to mitigate risk.\u201d It was also acknowledged that a few limitations affected the generalizability of the study, such as\nthe lack of socioeconomic data, the study sample being predominantly white males, and including only veterans, the latter of which is a population\nwhere comorbidities are more prevalent. Consequently, these data may be reflective of \u201cthe complex interplay of disease severity, treatment, and\nsociodemographic factors,\u201d as is the case with other clinical findings.\nWhile poor outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) have been linked to diabetes, its relation to pre\u2010infection glycemic control is still unclear.\nBecause of this, Merzon, et al. (2021) investigated the association between pre\u2010infection HemoglobinA1c (A1C) levels and COVID\u201019 severity as\nassessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients (ages 14 to 103) with diabetes tested for COVID\u201019 in Leumit Health Services, Israel,\nbetween February 1 and April 30, 2020. Of the patients in this cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. A comparison of the mean HbA1c of\nthose who were COVID-19 positive (7.19%, 95% CI: 6.81%-7.57%) and the mean of those who were COVID-19 negative (6.59%, 95% CI: 6.52%-6.65%)\nwas found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). The authors expounded further by reporting the clinical characteristics of patients with diabetes\nhospitalized due to COVID-19 by demonstrating that the mean Hb1Ac levels between those hospitalized (n=46, 7.75%, 95% CI: 7.17%-8.32%) and those\nnot hospitalized (n=137, 6.83%, 95% CI: 6.54%-7.13%) were also statistically significant (p<0.005). Additionally, \u201cIn a multivariate logistic regression\nmodel adjusting for multiple potential risk factors and chronic conditions which may have a deleterious effect on disease outcomes (including age, sex,\nsmoking, IHD, SES, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, CVA, CHF, chronic lung disease, and obesity), only HbA1c \u2265 nine\npercent remained a significant predictor for hospitalization.\u201d Given the evidence, the researchers\u00a0urge \u201cPaying special attention to patients with\ndiabetes and an HbA1c \u2265 nine while allowing a more lenient approach to patients with well controlled disease,\u201d as this can reduce economic, social, and\npatient burden, especially for those who are at the greatest risk for reacting severely to COVID-19.\nXie, et al. (2021) investigated the role of FPG and glucose fluctuation on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients who already had prior diagnoses of\ndiabetes. Through a multivariate Cox analysis, the researchers found that FPG was \u201can independent prognostic factor of overall survival after\nadjustment for age, sex, diabetes, and severity of COVID-19 at admission (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.25).\u201d However, blood glucose fluctuation was\nassociated with COVID-19 disease progression, as proven by the results found from the indices of the standard deviation of blood glucose and the\nlargest amplitude of glycemic excursions. Both FPG and blood glucose fluctuation indices were also found to be positively associated with increased\npresence of inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19, such as the \u201cwhite blood cell absolute count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, alkaline\nphosphatase, a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (\u03b1-hbdh), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase, [and] D-dimer.\u201d Ultimately, it was\nconcluded that diabetes was not an independent risk factor for in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients, as these findings were identified regardless of\ndiabetes status.\nYang, et al. (2019) aimed to find the appropriate threshold for FPG for defining prediabetes among children and adolescents. The sample was selected\nfrom school-aged children in Taiwan via a nationwide survey administered between 1992-2000, who then underwent physical examinations and blood\ntests if they exhibited abnormal urine test findings. The researchers found that the incidence of pediatric diabetes increased with increasing fasting\nplasma glucose levels, and those with FPG > 5.6mmol/L had higher adjusted hazard ratios. Additionally, \u201cthe association between fasting plasma\nglucose and incident pediatric diabetes and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were similar in boys and girls and were higher in\nthe age group twelve to eighteen years.\u201d In using 4.75 mmol/L as the optimal threshold for children six to eleven years, the sensitivity was 65% and\nspecificity was 51%. For the threshold of 5.19 mmol/L among children twelve to eighteen years, the sensitivity was 60% and the specificity was 73%.\nThis supports utilizing FPG as a supplement for diagnosing prediabetes among pediatric patients, which may contribute to better disease management.\nGeifman-Holtzman, et al. (2010) assessed the correlation between fetal macrosomia and abnormal OGTT in pregnant individuals with term gestation and\nnegative glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24 to 28 weeks. They recruited patients who had estimated fetal weights >90th percentile and a negative 50g\nGCT. From 170 individuals over a five-month period, they found that 10 patients or 5.9% had \u201cimpaired glucose metabolism at term.\u201d In this group, \u201cwe\nfound no correlation between GCT values at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks, family history of diabetes mellitus, the patient\u2019s [body mass index] or\nweight at term, and the diagnosis of impaired glucose metabolism.\u201d Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in mean fetal weight\nbetween those with normal versus abnormal OGTT. This demonstrated the lack of clinical utility of using OGTT at term for predicting the incidence of\nfetal macrosomia. The researchers suggested utilizing a larger scale study to solidify or contradict these conclusions.\nBi, et al. (2024) engaged in a cross-sectional study of participants aged >20 years old who underwent physical examination at the local hospital from\n2022 to 2023. A model was used to assess the dose-response relationship between liver enzymes and type 2 diabetes risk. Of the 14,100 participants,\nan analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between liver enzymes and\u00a0type 2 diabetes risk (P non-linear < 0.001). Specifically, type 2 diabetes risk\nincreased with rising ALT and GGT levels (range, <50 IU/L) and then leveled out when ALT and GGT levels were >50 IU/L. An elevated AST within a\ncertain range (range, <35 IU/L) decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes, but a mildly elevated AST (>35 IU/L) showed as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\nIn conclusion, liver enzymes were associated non-linearly with type 2 diabetes risk in different populations. Higher ALT and GGT levels were shown in\nthis study to increase type 2 diabetes risk as well. In conclusion, additional attention should be paid to elevated liver enzymes and diabetes, but more\nwork also needs to be done to assess association between elevation and T2D risk.\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA)\nThe ADA publishes an extensive guideline encompassing the standards of medical care in diabetes.

An A1C of <7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate for many children\u201d Grade B.\nPregnancy (Ch 15)\n\u201c\u2026although A1c may be useful, it should be used as a secondary measure of glycemic control in pregnancy, after blood glucose monitoring.\u201d\n\u201cFasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring are recommended in individuals with diabetes in pregnancy to achieve optimal\nglucose levels. Glucose goals are fasting plasma glucose <95 mg/dL (<5.3 mmol/L) and either 1-h postprandial glucose <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L)\nor 2-h postprandial glucose <120 mg/dL (<6.7 mmol/L) Grade B\u201d\n\u201cDue to increased red blood cell turnover, A1C is slightly lower during pregnancy in people with and without diabetes. Ideally, the A1C goal in\npregnancy is <6% (<42 mmol/mol) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, but the goal may be relaxed to <7% (<53 mmol/mol) if\nnecessary to prevent hypoglycemia Grade B\u201d\n\u201cGiven the alteration in red blood cell kinetics during pregnancy and physiological changes in glycemic parameters, A1c levels may need \u201cto be\nmonitored more frequently than usual (e.g., monthly).\u201d\n\u201cThe OGTT is recommended over A1C at four to twelve weeks postpartum because A1C may be persistently impacted (lowered) by the increased\nred blood cell turnover related to pregnancy, by blood loss at delivery, or by the preceding three-month glucose profile. The OGTT is more\nsensitive at detecting glucose intolerance, including both prediabetes and diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cBecause GDM often represents previously undiagnosed prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, or even developing\ntype 1 diabetes, individuals with GDM should be tested for persistent diabetes or prediabetes at four to twelve weeks postpartum with a fasting\n75-g OGTT using nonpregnancy criteria as outlined in Section two, \u201cClassification and Diagnosis of Diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, a positive screen for diabetes requires two abnormal values. If both the fasting plasma glucose\n(\u2265126 mg/dL [7.0 mmol/L]) and 2-h plasma glucose (\u2265200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L]) are abnormal in a single screening test, then the diagnosis of\ndiabetes is made. If only one abnormal value in the OGTT meets diabetes criteria, the test should be repeated to confirm that the abnormality\npersists.\u201d\n\u201cIndividuals with a history of GDM should have ongoing screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes every 1\u20133 years, even if the results of the\ninitial 4\u201312 week postpartum 75-g OGTT are normal. Ongoing evaluation may be performed with any recommended glycemic test (e.g., annual\nA1C, annual fasting plasma glucose, or triennial 75-g OGTT using thresholds for nonpregnant individuals).\u201d\nHeart Failure Considerations (ch. 10)\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals, routine screening for coronary artery disease is not recommended, as it does not improve outcomes as long as\nASCVD risk factors are treated.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cConsider investigations for coronary artery disease in the presence of any of the following: atypical cardiac symptoms; signs or symptoms of\nassociated vascular disease, including carotid bruits, transient ischemic attack, stroke, claudication, or PAD; or electrocardiogram abnormalities\n(e.g., Q waves).\u201d Grade E\n\u201cAdults with diabetes are at increased risk for the development of asymptomatic cardiac structural or functional abnormalities (stage B heart\nfailure) or symptomatic (stage C) heart failure. Consider screening adults with diabetes by measuring a natriuretic peptide (B-type natriuretic\npeptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-BNP [NTproBNP]) to facilitate prevention of stage C heart failure.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and abnormal natriuretic peptide levels, echocardiography is recommended to identify stage B heart\nfailure.\u201d Grade A\n\u201cIn asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and age \u226550 years, microvascular disease in any location, or foot complications or any end-organ\ndamage from diabetes, screening for PAD with ankle-brachial index testing is recommended to guide treatment for cardiovascular disease\nprevention and limb preservation. A In individuals with diabetes duration \u226510 years, screening for PAD should be considered\u201d Grade B.\nNonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis & Chronic Kidney Disease (ch. 4 and ch. 11)\nFrom chapter 4:\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, particularly those with obesity or cardiometabolic risk factors or established cardiovascular disease,\nshould be screened/risk stratified for clinically significant liver fibrosis (defined as moderate fibrosis to cirrhosis) using a calculated fibrosis-4\nindex (FIB-4) (derived from age, ALT, AST, and platelets\u2026even if they have normal liver enzymes.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with diabetes or prediabetes with persistently elevated plasma aminotransferase levels for >6 months and low FIB-4 should be evaluated\nfor other causes of liver disease.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with an indeterminate or high FIB-4 should have additional risk stratification by liver stiffness\nmeasurement with transient elastography or the blood biomarker enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF).\u201d Grade B\n\u201cAdults with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with indeterminate results or at high risk for significant liver fibrosis (i.e., by FIB-4, liver stiffness\nmeasurement, or ELF) should be referred to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for further workup. Interprofessional care is recommended for\nlong-term management Grade B.\u201d\nFrom chapter 11:\nAdditionally: \u201cA screening strategy based on elevated plasma aminotransferases >40 units/L would miss most individuals with NASH in these settings,\nas clinically significant fibrosis (\u2265F2) is frequently observed with plasma aminotransferases below the commonly used cutoff of 40 units/L. The American\nCollege of Gastroenterology considers the upper limit of normal ALT levels to be 29\u201333 units/L for male individuals and 19\u201325 units/L for female\nindividuals, as higher levels are associated with increased liver-related mortality, even in the absence of identifiable risk factors. The FIB-4 estimates\nthe risk of hepatic cirrhosis and is calculated from the computation of age, plasma aminotransferases (AST and ALT), and platelet count.\u201d\nIn regards to A1c and NASH, the ADA restricts its comments to the following: \u201cThe only proven primary prevention interventions for CKD in people with\ndiabetes are blood glucose (A1C goal of 7%) and blood pressure control (blood pressure <130/80 mmHg),\u201d and \u201cIntensive lowering of blood glucose with\nthe goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large, randomized studies to delay the onset and progression of albuminuria and reduce\neGFR in people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Insulin alone was used to lower blood glucose in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial\n(DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study of type 1 diabetes, while a variety of agents were used in clinical trials of type\n2 diabetes, supporting the conclusion that lowering blood glucose itself helps prevent CKD and its progression. The effects of glucose-lowering\ntherapies on CKD have helped define A1C goals.\u201d\nHospital Care Delivery Standards and Perioperative Care (ch. 16)\n49\n50\n51\n52,53\n54\n54\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n8/15\n\u201cPerform an A1C test on all people with diabetes or hyperglycemia (random blood glucose >140 mg/dL [>7.8 mmol/L]) admitted to the hospital if\nno A1C test result is available from the prior 3 months.\u201d Grade B\n\u201cIn hospitalized individuals with diabetes who are eating, point-of-care (POC) blood glucose monitoring should be performed before meals; in\nthose not eating, glucose monitoring is advised every 4\u20136 h. More frequent POC blood glucose monitoring ranging from every 30 min to every 2 h\nis the required standard for safe use of intravenous insulin therapy.\u201d (No grade; statement)\nThe following approach may be considered for those in preoperative and perioperative care:\n\u201cA preoperative risk assessment should be performed for people with diabetes who are at high risk for ischemic heart disease and those with\nautonomic neuropathy or renal failure.\nThe A1C goal for elective surgeries should be <8% (<63.9 mmol/L) whenever possible.\nThe blood glucose goal in the perioperative period should be 100\u2013180 mg/dL (5.6\u201310.0 mmol/L) within 4 h of the surgery. CGM should not be\nused alone for glucose monitoring during surgery.\nMetformin should be held on the day of surgery.\nSGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued 3\u20134 days before surgery.\nHold other oral glucose-lowering agents the morning of surgery or procedure and give one-half of NPH dose or 75\u201380% doses of long-acting\nanalog insulin or adjust insulin pump basal rates based on the type of diabetes and clinical judgment.\nMonitor blood glucose at least every 2\u20134 h while the individual takes nothing by mouth and dose with short- or rapid-acting insulin as needed.\nThere is little data on the safe use and/or influence of GLP-1 receptor agonists on glycemia and delayed gastric emptying in the perioperative\nperiod.\nStricter perioperative glycemic goals are not advised, as perioperative glycemic goals stricter than 80\u2013180 mg/dL (4.4\u201310.0 mmol/L) may not\nimprove outcomes and are associated with more hypoglycemia.\nCompared with usual dosing, a reduction by 25% of basal insulin given the evening before surgery is more likely to achieve perioperative blood\nglucose goals with a lower risk for hypoglycemia.\nIn individuals undergoing noncardiac general surgery, basal insulin plus premeal short- or rapid-acting insulin (basal-bolus) coverage has been\nassociated with improved glycemic outcomes and lower rates of perioperative complications compared with the reactive, correction-only short- or\nrapid-acting insulin coverage alone with no basal insulin dosing.\u201d\nThe ADA did not specifically mention \u201cbariatric surgery\u201d in their hospital care delivery section (ch. 16).\nDiabetes Canada Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee\nThis Expert Committee published a comprehensive guideline on the prevention and management of diabetes. Relevant items, recommendations, and\ncomments\u2014particularly those relating to the use of A1c testing\u2014are captured below:\n\u201cScreen for type 2 diabetes using a fasting plasma glucose and/or glycated hemoglobin (A1C) every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or\nin individuals at high risk on a risk calculator (33% chance of developing diabetes over ten years).\u201d\n\u201cIn the absence of evidence for interventions to prevent or delay type 1 diabetes, routine screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended.\u201d\n\u201cFor most individuals with diabetes, A1C should be measured approximately every three months to ensure that glycemic goals are being met or\nmaintained. In some circumstances, such as when significant changes are made to therapy, or during pregnancy, it is appropriate to check A1C\nmore frequently. Testing at least every six months should be performed in adults during periods of treatment and healthy behavior stability when\nglycemic targets have been consistently achieved.\u201d\nA1C can be misleading in various medical conditions (\u201ce.g., hemoglobinopathies, iron deficiency, hemolytic anemia, severe hepatic or renal\ndisease\u201d) and should not be used for \u201cdiagnostic use in children and adolescents (as the sole diagnostic test), pregnant [individuals] as part of\nroutine screening for gestational diabetes, those with cystic fibrosis or those with suspected type 1 diabetes.\u201d\nDiabetes \u201cshould\u201d be diagnosed at a level of A1C \u22656.5%.\n\u201cScreening for diabetes using FPG and/or A1C should be performed every three years in individuals \u226540 years of age or at high risk using a risk\ncalculator [Grade D, Consensus]. Earlier testing and/or more frequent follow up (every six to twelve months) with either FPG and/or A1C should\nbe considered in those at very high risk using a risk calculator or in people with additional risk factors for diabetes [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d\nIt should be mentioned that \u201cGlycemic targets should be individualized [Grade D, Consensus]\u201d based upon various considerations including, but not\nlimited to, the patient\u2019s functional dependence, medical history, life expectancy, and life course stage. Moreover, the grading of recommendations above\n(e.g., \u201cGrade D\u201d) reflect the methodological rigor used at arriving at the conclusion, such that lower grades reflect the presence of weaker evidence. But\nthough the \u201cpaucity of clinical evidence addressing the areas of therapy, prevention, diagnosis or prognosis precluded the assignment of a higher\ngrade,\u201d the authors recognize and note that many Grade D recommendations are \u201cvery important to the contemporary management of diabetes.\u201d\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)\nThe USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who are overweight or obese, and such\n\u201cScreening tests for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes include measurement of fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c level or an oral glucose tolerance test.\u201d\nRecognizing that \u201cThe optimal screening interval for adults with an initial normal glucose test result is uncertain,\u201d the USPSTF suggests that \u201cScreening\nevery three years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels.\u201d\nThe USPSTF has also provided guidelines pertaining to the screening of gestational diabetes. For asymptomatic pregnant persons at 24 weeks\ngestation or after, with a letter \u201cB\u201d grade, the USPSTF recommends screening for gestational diabetes in this population. However, in asymptomatic\npregnant persons before 24 weeks gestation, the USPSTF states that \u201ccurrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of\nscreening\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nAn \u201cI\u201d grade is defined by the USPSTF as \u201cI Statement- The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits\nand harms cannot be determined.\u201d\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n9/15\nIn 2022, the USPSTF released its first recommendation on screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. This recommendation applies to\nchildren and adolescents who are not pregnant and who are younger than 18 years of age without known diabetes or prediabetes and who are without\nsymptoms of diabetes or prediabetes. The USPSTF states that the goal of screening for type 2 diabetes in young people is \u201cto diagnose and treat it\nearly to prevent development of bad health outcomes. However, no studies have looked at the link between screening for type 2 diabetes in children and\nadolescents and bad health outcomes. Studies about the effect of type 2 diabetes treatment on health outcomes in children and adolescents have not\nhad enough patients with bad outcomes to draw any meaningful conclusions. No studies have looked at harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in young\npeople. Potential harms may include side effects from medications used to treat diabetes, such as low blood glucose, nausea, or vomiting.\u201d Based on\nthe current evidence for asymptomatic children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age, the USPSTF concluded that \u201ccurrent evidence is\ninsufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents\u201d and has given it an \u201cI\u201d grade.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)\nThe Global Report on Diabetes states that: \u201cGlycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the method of choice for monitoring glycaemic control in diabetes. An\nadvantage of using HbA1c is that the patient does not need to be in a fasting state. Ideally it should be measured twice a year in people\u00a0with type 2\ndiabetes and more frequently in those with type 1 diabetes. However, HbA1c testing is more costly than glucose measurement, and therefore less\nreadily available. If HbA1c testing is not available, fasting, or post-meal blood glucose is an acceptable substitute.\u201d\nThe WHO also published a \u201cmodule\u201d titled \u201cHearts-D: Diagnosis and Management of Type 2 Diabetes in 2020. In it, a testing algorithm for \u201ctreatment of\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin\u201d is included at the bottom. The algorithm calls for an HbA1c assessment to be performed \u201cin three months\u201d if the\npatient is stabilized as a result of the insulin treatment.\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)\nIn 2022, the AAFP published a clinical summary of the USPSTF recommendation for screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The\ndocument deferred to the USPSTF recommendations, with the testing audience being \u201cNonpregnant adults aged thirty-five to seventy years who have\noverweight or obesity and no symptoms of diabetes\u201d\u2014a move from 40 years of age in the previous recommendation\u2014while deeming screening every\nthree years to be a reasonable approach.\nEndocrine Society\nThe Endocrine Society published this guideline regarding management of diabetes in older adults. In it, they recommend screening for prediabetes or\ndiabetes every two years for patients 65 years or older. FPG and/or HbA1c may be used. However, the Society does recommend caution when\ninterpreting HbA1c results, as older patients are more likely to have conditions that alter red blood cell turnover.\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\nNICE published an update to their guideline on diabetes management. In it, they make the following recommendations:\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c levels in adults with type 2 diabetes every:\nThree to six months (tailored to individual needs) until HbA1c is stable on unchanging therapy.\nSix months once the HbA1c level and blood glucose lowering therapy are stable.\u201d\n\u201cMeasure HbA1c using methods calibrated according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) standardization.\u201d\n\u201cIf HbA1c monitoring is invalid because of disturbed erythrocyte turnover or abnormal haemoglobin type, estimate trends in blood glucose control using\none of the following:\nquality-controlled plasma glucose profiles\ntotal glycated haemoglobin estimation (if abnormal haemoglobins)\nfructosamine estimation.\u201d\n\u201cInvestigate unexplained discrepancies between HbA1c and other glucose measurements. Seek advice from a team with specialist expertise in diabetes\nor clinical biochemistry.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)\nThe AACE provides the following inclusion criteria for individuals who should be screened for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes:\nAge \u226545 years without other risk factors\nCVD or family history of T2D\nOverweight or obese\nSedentary lifestyle\nMember of an at-risk racial or ethnic group:\nAsian\nAfrican American\nHispanic\nNative American (Alaska Natives and American Indians)\nPacific Islander\nHigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level >250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L)\nImpaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and/or metabolic syndrome\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), acanthosis nigricans, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)\nHypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg or on antihypertensive therapy)\nHistory of gestational diabetes or delivery of a baby weighing more than 5 kg (9 lb)\nAntipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia and/or severe bipolar disease\nChronic glucocorticoid exposure\nSleep disorders in the presence of glucose intolerance (A1C >5.7%, IGT, or IFG on previous testing), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),\nchronic sleep deprivation, and night-shift occupation\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n10/15\nThe AACE recommends repeat testing at least every three years for individuals with normal results. Consider annual screening for patients with two or\nmore risk factors.\nIn a 2022 update focusing on developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan, the AACE expounds on how the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus\nshould be made. According to the authors, the ELs refer to evidence levels established by AACE evidence ratings, where \u201cdescriptors of \u201cmust,\u201d\n\u201cshould,\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d generally but not strictly correlate with Grade A (strong), Grade B (intermediate), and Grade C (weak) recommendations,\nrespectively.\u201d\nThe relevant recommendations are captured below.\n\u201cRecommendation 1.1\nThe diagnosis of DM is based on the following criteria\u2026:\nFPG concentration \u2265126 mg/dL (after \u2265 eight hours of an overnight fast), or\nPlasma glucose (PG) concentration \u2265200 mg/dL two hours after ingesting a 75-g oral glucose load after an overnight fast of at least eight hours,\nor\nSymptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia) and a random (nonfasting) PG concentration \u2265200 mg/dL, or\nA1C level \u22656.5%\nDiagnosis of DM requires two abnormal test results, either from the same sample or two abnormal results on samples drawn on different days. However,\na glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms for DM confirms the diagnosis of DM.\nGrade A; BEL 2 and expert opinion of task force\nRecommendation 1.2\nPrediabetes is identified by the presence of IFG (100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), which is a PG value of 140 to 199 mg/dL two\nhours after ingesting 75 g of glucose, and/or A1C value between 5.7% and 6.4% (Table 4). A1C should be used only for screening for prediabetes. The\ndiagnosis of prediabetes, which may manifest as either IFG or IGT, should be confirmed with glucose testing.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.3\nT1D is characterized by marked insulin deficiency in the presence of hyperglycemia and positive autoantibody tests to glutamic acid decarboxylase\n(GAD65), pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells (tyrosine phosphatase IA-2), and IA-2b zinc transporter (ZnT8), and/or insulin. The presence of immune markers and\nclinical presentation are needed to establish the correct diagnosis and to distinguish between T1D and T2D in children or adults, as well as to determine\nappropriate treatment.\nGrade A; BEL 2\nRecommendation 1.4\nT2D is characterized by progressive loss of \u03b2-cell insulin secretion and variable defects in insulin sensitivity. T2D is often asymptomatic and can remain\nundiagnosed for many years; therefore, all adults \u226535 years of age with risk factors should be screened for DM (Table 5).\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.5\nGDM is defined as carbohydrate intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy and resolves postpartum. Pregnant individuals with risk\nfactors for DM should be screened at the first prenatal visit for undiagnosed T2D using standard criteria (Table 4).\nGrade B; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.6\nScreen all pregnant individuals for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Diagnose GDM with either the one-step or the two-step\napproach.\nThe one-step approach uses a two-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after \u2265 eight hours of fasting with diagnostic cutoffs of one or\nmore FPG \u226592 mg/dL, one-hour PG \u2265180 mg/dL, or two-hour PG \u2265153 mg/dL.\nThe two-step approach uses a nonfasting one-hour 50-g glucose challenge test with one-hour PG screening threshold of 130 or 140 mg/dL. For\nindividuals with a positive screening test, the three-hour 100-g OGTT is used for diagnosis with two or more PG tests that meet the following\nthresholds: FPG \u226595 mg/dL, 1-hour \u2265180 mg/dL, 2-hour \u2265155 mg/dL, 3-hour \u2265140 mg/dL.\nGrade A; BEL 1\nRecommendation 1.7\nClinicians should consider evaluation for monogenic DM in any child or young adult with an atypical presentation, clinical course, or response to\ntherapy. Monogenic DM includes neonatal diabetes and nonautoimmune diabetes of multiple genetic causes, also known as maturity-onset diabetes of\nthe young (MODY). Most children with DM occurring under six months of age have a monogenic cause as autoimmune T1D rarely occurs before six\nmonths of age. Other monogenic forms of diabetes are characterized by mutation of genes of transcription factors, genes regulating pancreatic\ndevelopment or atrophy, abnormal insulin genes, genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress that impair insulin secretion, or abnormal glucokinase\ngenes that cause impaired insulin signaling.\nGrade B; BEL 2\nAlthough not expressly listed as recommendations for diabetes screening, some additional information of note includes the following:\n\u201cA glucose level \u2265200 mg/dL in the presence of hyperglycemia symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia confirm the diagnosis of DM. In\nindividuals with discordant results from two different tests, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated on a different\nday.\u201d\n\u201cIn view of physiological changes in pregnancy that could affect glycated hemoglobin levels, A1C should not be used for GDM screening or\ndiagnosis of DM.\u201d\n66\n12/16/25, 11:39 AM\nDiabetes Mellitus Testing\nhttps://www.southcarolinablues.com/web/public/brands/medicalpolicy/external-policies/diabetes-mellitus-testing/\n11/15\n\u201cAll pregnant individuals should be screened for GDM at twenty-four to twenty-eight weeks\u2019 gestation. Universal screening is recommended, as\nselective screening (only in individuals with risk factors) would miss a significant number of individuals with GDM and universal screening has\nbeen shown to be cost-effective compared with selective screening.\u201d\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE)\nThe 2020 Consensus Statement from the AACE/ACE on the Management of Type 2 Diabetes states:\n\"The hemoglobin A1c (A1c) target should be individualized based on numerous factors such as age, life expectancy, comorbid conditions,\nduration of diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia or adverse consequences from hypoglycemia, patient motivation, and adherence.\"\n\u201cAn A1c level of \u22646.5% is considered optimal if it can be achieved in a safe and affordable manner, but higher targets may be appropriate for\ncertain individuals and may change for a given individual over time.\u201d\n\u201cTherapy must be evaluated frequently (e.g., every three months) until stable using multiple criteria, including A1c, SMBG records (fasting and\npostprandial) or continuous glucose monitoring tracings, documented and suspected hypoglycemia events, lipid and BP values, adverse events\n(weight gain, fluid retention, hepatic or renal impairment, or CVD), comorbidities, other relevant laboratory data, concomitant drug administration,\ncomplications of diabetes, and psychosocial factors affecting patient care. Less frequent monitoring is acceptable once targets are achieved.\u201d\nIn 2023, the AACE/ACE released \u201cGuidelines and Recommendations for Laboratory Analysis in the Diagnosis and Management of Diabetes Mellitus.\u201d\nDiagnosis related recommendations:\n\u201cFasting glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used to establish the diagnosis of diabetes, with a value \u22657.0 mmol/L (\u2265126 mg/dL)\ndiagnostic of diabetes. A (high)\u201d\nScreening related recommendations:\n\u201cRecommendation: Screening by HbA1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT is recommended for individuals who are at high risk of diabetes. If HbA1c is <5.7%\n(<39 mmol/mol), FPG is <5.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL), and/or 2-h plasma glucose is <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year\nintervals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Glucose should be measured in venous plasma when used for screening of high-risk individuals. B (moderate)\nRecommendation: Plasma glucose should be measured in an accredited laboratory when used for diagnosis of or screening for diabetes. GPP\n(good practice point)\u201d\nMonitoring/Prognosis:\n\u201cRecommendation: Routine measurement of plasma glucose concentrations in a laboratory is not recommended as the primary means of\nmonitoring or evaluating therapy in individuals with diabetes. B (moderate)\u201d\nKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Diabetes Working Group\nThe KDIGO group published recommendations on diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). They recommend using HbA1c to monitor diabetic and\nCKD patients twice a year or as often as four times a year if glycemic target is not met or a change is made in therapy. KDIGO advises that \"accuracy\nand precision of HbA1c measurement declines with advanced CKD, particularly among patients treated by dialysis, in whom HbA1c measurements have\nlow reliability.\" They also recommend an \"individualized HbA1c target ranging from <6.5% to <8.0% in patients with diabetes and CKD not treated with\ndialysis.\u201d\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology\nMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a condition where there is a buildup of fat in the liver.
